    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Genesis 3:17-19, Psalm 78:1-7, Isaiah 30:15-18, Joel 2:12, Acts 3:19-20, Romans 3:22-23, Colossians 2:6-14\nFrom the moment our first parents were deceived by the serpent, we have been striving. “You will eat bread by the sweat of your brow until you return to the ground,” God told them (Genesis 3:19). And so we toil—whether sitting at a desk or plowing the land, studying for classes or scouring job listings, growing children or crops or companies. The work is not easy and, truth be told, it overtakes us. It is no surprise, then, that this is how we view the work of our salvation: as a matter of toiling and striving.\nIf achievement and acclaim are our chief end, effort is our primary means. That is the world’s gospel, but it is not the gospel of Jesus. The salvation offered by God in Jesus Christ does not follow the world’s rule of merit. All of Scripture is a story of God’s unearned love and unmerited faithfulness toward a rebellious people. It is an exodus story, where the primary job of the rescuee is to trust the Rescuer. \nIsaiah 30:15 reads: “For the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said: ‘You will be delivered by returning and resting; your strength will lie in quiet confidence.’” It’s a deep breath, this verse. A deliverance that comes from rest and quiet? What a dream. \nBut rest and quiet—much less returning to our holy God—do not come naturally to our Genesis 3 hearts. Our tendency is to run. The verse continues: “But you are not willing. You say, ‘No! We will escape on horses’—therefore you will escape!—and, ‘We will ride on fast horses’—but those who pursue you will be faster” (Isaiah 30:15-16). \nWe cannot outrun, outwit, or outwork our sin. No amount of effort or grit or good intention can deliver us from the world of death and dust. As hopeless as it may sound, this truth rings of freedom! We cannot deliver ourselves, but the One who can deliver us has come. \nLent is a long, slow season where we pause to remember who we are, who God is, and what Jesus has done. We are made from dust with love and intention, in the image of our Creator (Genesis 1:27). We have sinned and we are sinners, incapable of saving ourselves (Romans 6:23). Jesus Christ is the perfect expression of God’s eternal love and faithfulness, given to reconcile us to Himself (Colossians 1:19-20). We are invited to repent of our sin, return to our merciful and compassionate God, and rest in the freedom of His grace and forgiveness (Acts 3:19-20).\nHis love for us cannot be outdone or undone. Enter this season of repentance and remembrance with humility, willing to see and confess your sin. And enter with confidence, trusting in the completed work of Jesus Christ on your behalf. Don’t bother running away on fast horses or hiding behind your best efforts. Run to Him, and rest.\n \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Genesis 15:13-15, Psalm 136:1-26, Luke 24:13-32\nJesus said the book of Exodus was about Him. \nTo the religious leaders who wanted to kill Him, Jesus said, “if you believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me” (John 5:46). And when He appeared to the travelers on the road to Emmaus after He had risen, “beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted for them the things concerning himself in all the Scriptures” (Luke 24:27). Passages like these tell us there is no better way to read to the book of Exodus than in light of Jesus’ cross and empty tomb.\nThe entire story of Exodus rests on promises God made to His people. There is the promise the Lord made to Abraham four hundred years earlier—to take his descendants as His own and love them with an everlasting love (Genesis 12:1–3). Exodus says it was because of this ancient promise to Abraham that God delivered the people of Moses (Exodus 2:24). This has always been the way of the Lord. The grace He extends to you and me is not based on how He feels about us in any given moment. His faithfulness is anchored in ancient promises He made long before we were born. God doesn’t change. His steadfast love endures forever (Psalm 136:1).\nBut there is an even greater promise at work in Exodus than the one He made to Abraham. When Adam and Eve sinned against the Lord, God swore that one would come from the woman who would crush evil’s head (Genesis 3:15). The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus is the fulfillment of that promise. Every word of Scripture that follows rests on God’s vow to redeem and restore His sinful, wayward people to Himself, which He accomplished through the ministry of His Son. \nExodus points to how Jesus would save us. We see Him in the Passover Lamb, in the bread from heaven, in the water that flowed when the rock was struck, and in the burning bush which spoke the name “I AM.” We see Him in the liberation of a people oppressed by tyranny and enslaved to the kingdom of this world. Even more, we see Jesus as the presence of God coming down from heaven to dwell among His people (Exodus 40:34-35, John 1:14).\nWhen we stop to ask why any of these events took place, the answer is because God made a promise. He made a promise to rescue us from slavery to sin (Romans 6:18). He made a promise to lead us through the wilderness of this life (Psalm 23). And He made a promise to bring us into our eternal promised home (2 Corinthians 5:1). All these things have been accomplished for us through the sacrifice of our perfect Passover Lamb, Jesus—the Son of God (1 Peter 1:18-19).\nThe Bible is a book of promises made and promises kept, and Jesus is at the center of them all (2 Corinthians 1:20).\n\nRuss Ramsey and his wife and four children make their home in Nashville, Tennessee.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 1:1-22, Exodus 2:1-25, Genesis 35:11-12, Matthew 2:13-23\nTo hear and remember are two different things altogether. \nWhen I was young, and exceedingly rebellious, my parents would often call my specific species of disobedience “selective hearing.” But my excuse in return was often, “I know, Mom, but I forgot. I forgot to do what you asked. I forgot your rule. I forgot your request. I forgot to listen.” You moms know what I’m talking about. Whether it’s selective hearing, honest forgetfulness, or just plain old delayed obedience (which, as wise parents have told me is still disobedience), we’ve been coming up with excuses since history began. \nTo hear a thing and to remember it is a rare quality in all of us. We often hear the words people say but forget to be tender. Or we barely hear the words coming out of their mouths because we’re busy spending all of our energy coming up with some pithy words to say back. Far too often, we neither hear nor remember, and simply glaze over and zone out while others are talking. Our lack of attentiveness to the pain, needs, and preferences of others is apparent, and we don’t have to look far to find it. Worse still, it’s easy to project these human tendencies onto God, imagining He neither hears or remembers our prayers. But this is a distinctly human problem, there since the garden of Eden and the entrance of sin into the world. \nWhat is staggering about this passage is amidst the trauma, murder, hurt, neglect, and systemic injustice the people of God were experiencing, God was still hearing their cries and remembering His covenant. He had not forgotten and was not deaf to their cries for help, rescue, relief, or home. “God heard their groaning; and God remembered his covenant” (Exodus 2:24). Even as the earthly and wicked leader grew old, frail, and died, God was still on His throne hearing, preparing, remembering, and moving on behalf of His people. \nNone of us are immune to pain this side of heaven; Christ assured us we would know sorrow in this world (John 16:33). We can probably all readily recall some recent and very real struggle in our own lives. Today, as we operate in our selective hearing of our Father or delayed disobedience to the Holy Spirit or constant forgetfulness of the work of Christ on the cross for us, let’s remember afresh that God never ignores us or forgets us. Our Father is a perfect parent and His Son is a perfect Son. He keeps His promises. He is always active, always attentive, always remembering, and always moving on behalf of His children. \nOn your behalf today, God hears and remembers. He is coming soon.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner. She blogs at Sayable, and tweets and instagrams at @lorewilbert.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 3:1-22, Exodus 4:1-31, Joshua 5:13-15, Matthew 22:23-33\nI’ve never seen a burning bush, but I know how it feels to hide my face. \nAcceptance of the mission God had for Moses would mean leaving the life he had spent four decades building, facing the maniacal ruler of the most powerful nation in the world, fleeing again with only the clothes on his back and a nation to care for, and then leading the most miserable, insufferable group imaginable on a forty-year road trip through an unforgiving desert. \nMy calling may not be of Mosaic or burning-bush proportions, but what God asks of me, and of you, isn’t altogether different from what He required of Moses. \nWe are called to speak the truth in love, even to those who disrespect and disagree with us (Ephesians 4:15, 25). We are called to help lead people away from their slavery to sin and toward the Promised Land of freedom found in Christ (Matthew 28:19–20). We are called to run toward, not away from, pockets of suffering and hold high the staff of hope (Galatians 6:2). \nThis all sounds exciting in theory, but when the opportunity arises, our gut reaction is often the same as Moses’ response. We turn away from the call, begging, “Please, Lord, send someone else” (Exodus 4:13). If even a burning bush cannot compel us to run toward the mission God has for us, what will? \nRemembering what’s at stake. \nTucked here in between the ignition of the burning bush and Moses’ decision to obey, we find an object lesson as unsettling to us as it must have been to Moses. \nMoses’ staff becomes a snake (vv. 2–5) and his healthy hand becomes diseased (vv. 6–7) before a third sign is promised: the Nile River will turn to blood and will be spilled out on the dry ground (vv. 8–9). Sure, these are demonstrations of God’s power, but look again. This is a compelling reminder of who we are without Jesus. \nWe are snakebitten, attacked and weakened by the serpent who first struck in the garden. \nWe are diseased, desperately broken by sin and unable to cure our own sick hearts. \nThese first two signs show that we are enslaved to the taskmaster of sin without the means to break our own chains. The gospel is the only key that turns the lock for shackled people walking in darkness. We cannot hide our faces from this. \nThe third sign given to Moses runs like a river of hope through all of God’s Word and overflows into the banks of our lives. As Moses turned river water into blood and dumped it onto dry ground, he was preaching the gospel, pointing toward the day when the blood of our Savior would be spilled on a cracked and desperate world for the deliverance of our sin. In Exodus, the wooden staff of a shepherd was a foreshadowing of the wooden cross where the Good Shepherd would hang for us. \nMoses remembered what was at stake, slipped his sandals back on, and put one foot in front of the other, walking out his calling. And the Lord, used him mightily in order to set the captives free. \nLord, help us look across the table, across the street, and around the world, remember what’s at stake, and choose declare the gift of the gospel.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 5:1-23, Exodus 6:1-27, Isaiah 6:4-5, Psalm 68:4-6\nWhen I signed up for a half-marathon, I thought I was agreeing to the half with medals and snacks at the end. Unfortunately, the journey to the finish line was a little more than I bargained for.\nThe longest distance I ran when training for the race was 10 miles. I’d read about many types of training plans. Some encouraged running more than 13.1 miles to increase your confidence on race day, while others suggested running less and allowing the adrenaline to carry you through. Through a very close elimination process, I chose the latter because it involved less running.\nMy training prepared me for inclement weather, dehydration, hunger, and cramps. I mapped out where along the route I should slow down or speed up, and even curated a motivational playlist—complete with a special list of victory songs for the last mile. On the morning of the race, I suited up with every recommended accessory and piece of training advice, keeping my mind only on the task at hand. The first several miles went as planned, but as the day grew hotter, it felt like the finish line was running in the opposite direction. I’d lost count of the mile markers, but I knew I still had a long way to go. That is, until I locked eyes with an encouraging onlooker who said, “You’re almost there! It’s the last mile!”.\nExcept, it wasn’t. It was the beginning of the next-to-last mile, which is a detail that truly matters when your legs have already begun to turn to jelly.\nIt was God’s ultimate will for His people to be released from Pharaoh’s control. And yet, day by day, freedom must have seemed like it was crawling further and further away from the Israelites. Just when they thought their jobs couldn’t get any worse, they were forced to source their own supplies. Just when they thought their lives couldn’t get harder, they were afraid they’d have to rely on their own strength.\nMoses’ words to God seem to echo the thoughts of all His people: “Ever since I went in to Pharaoh to speak in your name he has caused trouble for this people, and you haven’t rescued your people at all” (Exodus 5:23).\nDo you still love us? \nDo you still see us? \nAre you still going to help us make it to the finish line?\nSeeing a promise through to its fulfillment demands perseverance. God does not promise us the shortest route or even the most painless, but as Corrie ten Boom puts it, “When a train goes through a tunnel and it gets dark, you don’t throw away the ticket and jump off. You sit still and trust the engineer.”\nThe distance may become longer. The steps may become more painful. The journey may become less predictable. But the same God who gives freedom also gives perseverance, purpose, and peace. His promise to Israel is His promise to us: “I will take you as my people, and I will be your God” (Exodus 6:7).\n\n",

We were driving the Blue Ridge Parkway outside of Asheville, North Carolina, after a day of hiking waterfalls with his brother. Mountains all around, crisp air, blue skies—it was nearly perfect… until a bumblebee flew up from under my seat, and I started shrieking. “PULL OVER PULL OVER RIGHT NOW!” I shouted, as he kept driving. \nRealistically, there was nowhere to pull over. We were driving winding mountain roads with no shoulder. I was panicking, and there was nothing he could do (except match my pitch and yell at me to calm down). Finally, a scenic overlook saved us. But my nerves were shot, and my brother-in-law had witnessed a “real marriage moment.” \nI can’t read Exodus 7 and 8 without cringing. A river of blood, frogs, gnats, flies just sounds gross. This is one of those passages that I try to skim over without putting myself in the scene: piles of dead frogs that filled the land with stench, and then “all the dust of the earth became gnats.” Is your skin crawling? Mine is. \nThe panic I felt driving down that mountain road, while feeling hunted by a hungry bumblebee, was probably nothing compared to the terror of being swarmed by flies, gnats, and frogs. In these pages from Exodus, Pharaoh goes back and forth in his response to God, who pulls back the plagues, hardens Pharaoh’s heart, and then sends an even worse plague. Sometimes the plagues are universal, affecting the Israelites in tandem with the Egyptians. Others, like the swarms of flies, are directed only at the Egyptians, while sparing the Israelites as only God can do. \nThe Egyptians believed that their gods controlled the very things that God commanded in the plagues. During the first three plagues, the magicians of Egypt call upon their gods to mimic what Moses and Aaron were doing. During the plague of the gnats, the magicians could not replicate the work of God. “For the LORD is a great God, a great King above all gods.” There is none like Him (Psalm 95:3; 86:8). \nThe meta-narrative of Exodus reveals God’s character to His people: He is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness (Exodus 34:6–7). The plagues serve to pull back and reveal another layer of God’s character. He demonstrates His authority over the earth, over the plants and animals, over His people, over all things. \nEventually, the plagues work; Pharaoh relents, and the Israelites are freed. God has rescued His people, but He has also shown them that He can be trusted, that He is in their corner, and that He has all authority in heaven and earth. \nHundreds of years later, God would come to earth as a man and again reveal His authority through a series of miracles—calming the sea, healing the sick, raising the dead—that showed His people and the watching world that He alone is God. We can sit in awe of His power today. \n\nMelanie Rainer is a bookworm from birth who makes her days writing, editing, and reading in Nashville, Tennessee.

The fields lay fallow. The animals huddle close to the barn rather than roaming the brown, sparse pastures. It’s the dead center of winter, and frankly, I’m sick of it. The cold I can handle. The bare trees don’t bother me much. It’s the darkness that gets me. As endless blackness settles in before supper each evening, I find myself flipping every switch in the house. \nWe weren’t made to dwell in darkness. \nPerhaps, as God’s plagues rose to a crescendo in the book of Exodus, we should not be surprised, that darkness came near the bitter end—\nAfter their water supply was poisoned\nAfter the frogs, gnats, and flies filled their homes\nAfter their livestock died\nAfter boils covered their bodies\nAfter hail mixed with thunder\nAfter locusts ate every leaf on every tree—\nAfter all that, came the darkness. And not just any darkness: “A darkness to be felt” (Exodus 10:21). This was a physical darkness, one I imagine Egypt must’ve felt in her bones. I have felt this kind of oppressive darkness in my own life. I bet you have too.\nSimply flip on the news, and the darkness of this world will wrap itself around you like an uncomfortable, scratchy blanket. Or standby as someone you love suffers with sickness, and feel the weight of darkness and fear that seem to seep into every fiber of your being. Watch marriages crumble around you, listen carefully as geopolitical leaders threaten to wipe each other off the globe—all while facing your own personal anxiety and sorrow.\nAs long as sin still exists among us and within us, we remain familiar with the plague of total darkness, feeling it in our bones too. Darkness, death, and sin force us to see our need for redemption. We must see our need before we can marvel in the grace of the gospel—the grace of Christ Jesus, who pushes back against all darkness. \n“And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.”\n– Revelation 22:5\nBecause of the ninth plague, the Egyptians huddled in paralyzing darkness for three whole days. They couldn’t have known it, but they were telling the first chapter of the greatest story ever told. As the Israelites gathered around the only light left in the land, they were foreshadowing the rest of the story. \nSoon enough, Jesus, our Savior, would spend three days in utter darkness (Matthew 12:40). Dead and buried in a borrowed tomb, He would wait, just like the Egyptians did. This Lenten season helps us watch the horizon, waiting with holy expectation to remember the moment when the stone rolled away and the darkness was obliterated by light. \nIn this gap between the Resurrection and Christ’s return, we remain the keepers of the light. No longer held captive by the darkness, we gather around the beacon of hope that is Jesus. Without the suffocating darkness, we’d never turn toward the light. God used a hard-hearted Pharaoh and a series of unthinkable calamities to reveal His glory, to prove that there is no one like Him in all the earth (Exodus 9:14).  \n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 12:1-51, Exodus 13:1-16, Psalm 51:7, John 1:29\nWhen I was a clumsy and uncoordinated middle schooler, I somehow managed to make the seventh grade cheerleading squad. I ended up loving it so much that it became the highlight of my awkward middle school years, and every year after, until I graduated from high school.\nOne of the biggest perks that came with being a member of the cheerleading squad was the cute t-shirt the school gave us to wear on game days. It was red, with “Eagles” embroidered across the front. Like a 12-year-old’s version of a letterman’s jacket, our red t-shirts were a way to show what we were a part of, where we belonged. We often use material objects to distinguish ourselves, like wearing wedding bands to mark a marriage covenant, or black clothing in times of grieving.\nIn Exodus 12, God told the Israelites to use a special tactic to protect themselves from the plague that He would be sending through the land of Egypt. The Israelites were to mark their doors using the blood of the lamb they’d slaughtered. When the Lord saw the blood above the door, He would pass over them, keeping them safe from the plague (Exodus 12:13). The Israelites called this event the Passover, and Moses instructed the elders of Israel to keep this tradition and celebrate it every year:\nWhen you enter the land that the Lord will give you as he promised, you are to observe this ceremony. When your children ask you, “What does this ceremony mean to you?” you are to reply, “It is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord, for he passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when he struck the Egyptians and spared our homes.”\n—Exodus 12:25-27\nThe blood of the lamb was a distinguishing mark for the Israelites as God’s people.\nThe blood of the lamb saved them from the destruction coming to the Egyptians as a result of the plague.\nAfter the lamb was sacrificed and the door marked with blood, the Lord brought the Israelites out of Egypt and out of slavery, by the strength of His hand (Exodus 13:16).\nIn a similar fashion, the blood of Christ is a distinguishing mark for us, as Christians. Because of Jesus, we are able to live freely by the grace He bought for us through His spotless life, death, and resurrection. His blood distinguishes us and sets us apart as a royal priesthood of believers called to spread the good news of the gospel to others (1 Peter 2:9). All of this is possible because “Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed” (1 Corinthians 5:7). \nThe blood of the Lamb is a distinguishing mark for us, reminding us of His sacrifice and setting us apart as believers.\nThe blood of the Lamb washes us whiter than snow (John 1:29).\nThe blood of the Lamb reminds us of our salvation and pushes us to live a life of freedom (Galatians 5:1).\nMy middle school cheerleading shirt was a fun distinguishing mark, but I’m thankful to have the mark of Christ’s blood to mark my salvation and proclaim my righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21). The Israelites were kept safe from the plague by the mark on their doors, and Christ’s blood is a mark on our hearts, of the redemption found in Him. Thanks be to God.\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 13:17-22, Exodus 14:1-31, Exodus 15:1-21, Psalm 106:1-12, Romans 6:1-4\n“If I ever find out you bothered my sister again, you’ll be dealing with me.”\nToya was on a mission. She hadn’t gotten on her sister’s crowded school bus for no reason. The previous afternoon, Jessica had gotten off her bus completely distraught; a classmate had told her she couldn’t sit near him because she was black. \nSeeing her little sister’s tears, anger had swelled up from deep inside of Toya to the point where she almost couldn’t see straight. She wanted to give that little boy a piece of her mind. She didn’t care who heard her, nor did she care that she wasn’t even allowed to be on that bus. Her sister needed her to speak up for her, and that’s exactly what she did. Jessica didn’t need to say a word in her own defense because Toya had said it all. I’ll bet the memory of Toya’s unexpected, fiery presence on the school bus stayed with that young man long after that day, stopping him in his tracks if he even thought to be mean to Jessica again. \nHow similar today’s passage from Exodus is—the story of God bringing the Israelites through the Red Sea.\nEgypt had oppressed Israel long enough; God heard their cries for deliverance and stepped in. He’d brought them safely out of Egypt (decked out in the finest Egyptian gold, silver, and clothing, no less!), and His presence went with them as they escaped (Psalm 139:7). \nExodus 13 describes God’s presence as a pillar of cloud or fire that led the people of God on their way to freedom. But God’s presence did more than lead the Israelites; it protected them. The very presence of God stood between Israel and her enemies, completely defeating them. Just like Toya’s unexpected presence on a school bus changed how her sister was treated by her peers, the presence of God redefined how the nations of the world understood Israel.\nHow much more so does the incarnate presence of God—Immanuel, “God with us”—Jesus Christ, stand between us and whatever enemy dares to accuse, attack, or ensnare us? If God’s presence in the form of a pillar of cloud and fire can rescue an entire nation and triumph over another, then surely the incomparable act of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross can change the entire world. And if a pillar of cloud and fire can cause the entire Egyptian army to drown in the Red Sea, then surely the resurrection of Jesus Christ tosses the power of death and sin into the abyss for eternity.  \nJust like Toya’s little sister on the bus and the Israelites caught between the Red Sea and a pursuing army, we, too, are silent observers, standing in awe of the God of the universe coming to our rescue. We didn’t have to convince God to save us. Long before we existed, He’d decided to rescue us with the mighty act of redemption that makes journeying across the Red Sea seem like a leap across a puddle. God sent Himself into this world to rescue us once and for all.\n\nErin Rose lives and works in vibrant Richmond, Virginia, where she serves as Worship & Teaching Pastor at East End Fellowship.  She is a graduate of the University of Virginia, and is currently enrolled as a graduate student at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.  Erin is a member of Urban Doxology, a ministry that is writing the soundtrack of reconciliation for the church.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 15:22-27, Exodus 16:1-36, Exodus 17:1-16, John 6:41-51, 1 Corinthians 10:1-5\nI struggle with the idea of provision. The cultural ideal tells me that if I want something done right, I should do it myself. And the American dream assures me that I can pull myself up by my own bootstraps, and take care of my business on my own. We can find this subtext of self-reliance in most of our films and stories. When the heroine wavers on the brink of a difficult challenge or important decision, where does she find the strength to go on? She finds it within herself, of course. This is how the constant cultural inundation with the message of self-reliance sneaks into our brains.\nSo when I’m confronted with real world dilemmas, like, “Honey, how are we going to pay the mortgage this month?” and “How can we possibly help and heal our trauma-scarred adopted son?” My first instinct is to smile through my gritted teeth and TRY HARDER. We can make more money if we just hustle more, and we can help our kid if we just find the right program. I want to depend on myself and find the strength within to make our life great. The problem is, strength doesn’t come from within.\nScripture tells us that strength comes from outside of ourselves; our strength comes from the Lord. In the wilderness, the Israelites couldn’t provide for themselves. He provided for them, raining down bread from heaven (Exodus 16:4). And in the New Testament, God sent Jesus to us, who said, “I am the living bread that came down from heaven” (John 6:51). He is our provision for our earthly and spiritual needs.\nObviously, we can’t swing to the extreme of giving up all effort and work. Work is good. God called us to use our hands to create (I Chronicles 22:15-16; Genesis 1:27; Ephesians 2:10). There is a reason hard exertion of effort is satisfying: it is good. “There is nothing better for man than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work. I have seen that even this is from God’s hand” (Ecclesiastes 2:24, HCSB). But our first line of provision is never our own effort, and it’s always God’s good gifts. The air we breathe, the sunsets we take in with awe, our very bodies—these are all good provisions from Him.\nWhile we are so often tempted to complain, wondering where our daily bread will come from, God is already leading us to a land with springs of water. Like the Israelites, we grow frustrated with God, wondering, Why are you taking me into this wilderness? (Exodus 17:1-7). But He has called us to trust Him, that no matter the wilderness we may wander, He will provide enough for us each and every day.\nRest in His provision, diligently gather the bread He offers, and know that He is the Lord.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Jethro’s Visit",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 18:1-27, Deuteronomy 17:8-11, Acts 6:1-7\nThe story of Jethro coming to the aid of Moses is an echo of an earlier story. In fact, so are the first eighteen chapters of Exodus. In them, we find a creation narrative patterned after Genesis 1. You could sum their message succinctly as, “And God said, ‘Let there be Israel.’ And it was so.” The newly-minted nation, like the newly-formed earth, is good. Moses has been charged with its care, but the task soon proves to be too much for one person. Observing his solo leadership efforts, Jethro says, “What you are doing is not good” (Exodus 18:17).\nNot good.\nJethro’s words echo God’s words in Genesis 2: “It is not good for the man to be alone” (Genesis 2:18). If there is to be orderly ruling and subduing, if there is to be fruitfulness and multiplication as God has decreed, the work cannot be done alone. Just as God provided Eve to be a necessary ally to Adam, He now provides Jethro and the leaders of Israel to be necessary allies to Moses.\nDon’t miss this: The concept of self-reliance is wholly foreign to the Christian faith. We are created to need God and others. We are designed for interdependence and community. There is no such thing as a Lone Ranger Christian. It matters that we understand this as we listen for the echo of our own story in that of Moses.\nEvery believer’s story is this: “And God said, ‘Let there be new life,’ and it was so.” You and I may not be called to bring orderly rule to a nation, as Moses did, but we are called to submit our hearts to God as He brings orderly rule to our hearts as new creations in Christ. The Bible calls this sanctification. In God’s name, we take dominion over sin. We cultivate the fruitfulness of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22). Like Moses and Adam, we are called to rule and subdue, to be fruitful and multiply. And like them, it is not good to attempt the good work alone. Nor is it necessary. God has provided necessary allies for us.\nFirst, He has sent His Spirit to comfort and convict. Any effort to grow in holiness apart from the help of the Spirit will teach us, as Jethro says, “The thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it alone” (Exodus 18:18). But He also sends help in the form of Christian community. He provides us teachers to guide us through the scriptures, mentors to guide us in wisdom, brothers and sisters to encourage us and hold us accountable. \nWhat sin are you striving to rule in your own strength? The thing is too heavy for you. Ask for the Spirit to train and convict you. Seek the ready help of the family of God. Trade self-reliance for the gift of dependence on the Spirit and interdependence with the saints. “So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you. If you do this, God will direct you, you will be able to endure” (Exodus 18:22-23).\n\nJen Wilkin is a wife, mom to four great kids, and an advocate for women to love God with their minds through the faithful study of his Word.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 19:1-25, Exodus 20:1-21, John 1:14-17, Hebrews 8:7-13\nPerhaps one of the most misunderstood aspects of the Old Testament is the law. It has been distorted and misapplied for thousands of years: It’s been used to fuel self-righteousness; to depict a judgmental and unforgiving portrait of God; interpreted so narrowly and harshly that its closest adherents didn’t recognize the “fulfillment of the Law” (Matthew 5:17), Jesus Himself, in their very midst.  \nThese misinterpretations still plague us today, so the question remains: how should we understand the law?\nIn Exodus 19, God provides Moses with the cornerstone of the law, the Ten Commandments, and He does so with these words: “Now if you will carefully listen to me and keep my covenant, you will be my own possession out of all the peoples, although the whole earth is mine, and you will be my kingdom of priests and my holy nation” (v. 5-6). Too often, we read these words as a threat, or a form of conditional love: I will only take care of you if you do what I say. \nHowever, there is another way to read these words, and the commandments that follow.\nAs a mom, I frequently warn my boys to obey me for their own good: \nIf you don’t listen to me, you’re going to get hurt.\nIf you don’t stop jumping on the bed, you’re going to fall.\nIf you don’t slow down, you’re going to trip.\nThese warnings are not threats. They are not signs of a conditional love. I am not manipulating them into submitting to me. Instead, I am beckoning them toward safety, wholeness, and health. I am showing them the path to life, and warning them away from a path that leads to pain.\nThis, in many ways, captures the heart of the law. And this heart becomes all the more clear in the verse that precedes God’s warning: \n“You have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself”(vv. 3-4). \nWith this verse, God testifies to His own character, reminding the Israelites of His steadfast love, provision, and care. On that basis, God asks His people to trust and obey Him—not because the law is an arbitrary list of rules from a cruel and exacting God, but because the law is the path to life.\nToo often, we miss this truth, that the law is beautiful, good, and a picture of humanity at its best. The first four commandments are, in essence, the pinnacle of “loving God.” The following six commandments are the fullness of “loving neighbor.” They instruct us on how to live, but more importantly, they clarify who we were created to be.\nAnd yet, the law fell short. It showed us the destination without providing the ability to reach it (Romans 8:3). We can know the good, but find ourselves wholly unable to attain it. That is why the law condemns: the law is God’s blueprint for human flourishing, without the tools to achieve it. \nEnter Jesus. He did what no human was ever able to do. He was the perfect expression of the law. His life and words were the embodiment of God’s design for us. That is the point of the Ten Commandments, and the whole of God’s law: to point us toward God’s good plan for us, while revealing our inadequacy to accomplish it. In short, the law points us to Jesus.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nExodus 20:22-26, Exodus 21:1-36, Isaiah 44:6, Matthew 22:36-40\nI know every word of the Bible is inspired. I know it’s all useful for teaching and righteousness, but what is happening in this passage?! These rules don’t make any sense, and they make me mad. Did you read the one making provision for what to do if you hit your slave and knock her down?  If she can get up after two days, it’s no problem, because she is your property?! (Exodus 21:21). Are you kidding me? I feel like I don’t even know where to start.\nBut I think that’s exactly how I can get a sense for the justice in these laws—they are a start, a beginning. In Exodus, God’s people had just escaped the unbearable cruelty of their Egyptian masters. So, for them, a start was to begin by treating each other with more justice and mercy than they had received at the hands of the Egyptians—to give an individual human life value.\nIn Egypt, they were beaten with no recourse and no accountability. Contrast this lawless and brutal reality with the orderliness of the laws in Exodus. Under these new laws, there were consequences for loss of life and destruction of property. And these laws introduced the basic “a life for a life” concept, which was the cornerstone of ancient justice.\nIt’s tempting for my personal sense of justice to be the primary lens through which I read these rules. But God is just and merciful, and abounding in loving kindness (Psalm 103:8). So while it’s hard for me to understand why these laws don’t fit my idea of perfect justice, it helps me to look at what Jesus said to His friends about the law.\nWhen Jesus’ disciples tried to interpret the law—to distill all the rules into one basic idea—they asked Him, “Teacher, which command in the law is the greatest?” Jesus responded with this simple, beautiful, and uniting command, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and most important command. The second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commands” (Matthew 22:36-40).\nAnd, though these ancient civil laws of Israel may strike us as strange and even upsetting, we can see that the center of them was this: Love the Lord your God. Love your neighbor.\nBut there’s more—because it’s totally unsatisfying to look at a passage like this and think, I don’t get it, but I’ll just accept it and ignore the difficulties. God isn’t afraid of our questions, our doubts, or even our objections. However, He is quite interested in transforming us. This means that we don’t get to brush this stuff away. Instead we are called to dig in, to seek to understand.\nThe beginning of this understanding, however, doesn’t come to us by leaning on our own understanding (Proverbs 3:5). Rather, we approach the difficulties remembering what we know: God is holy, just, merciful, and He is love (1 John 4:8). Yes, He is more loving than we are, and His laws for ancient Israel come from that love. When we make gods of gold for ourselves—or even gods of our own intellect, opinion, and understanding—we miss the mark. The law and God’s grace both exist for the same reason: to save us and to teach us to love the Lord. Begin there.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 22:1-31, Exodus 23:1-19, Proverbs 31:8-9, 1 Corinthians 10:24\nI have learned a lot about honesty and justice from having a roommate. First of all, it doesn’t matter what city you live in, how many people you live with, or the closeness of your friendship, sharing a bathroom is not fun. One of the largest offenses you can make as a roommate is stealing all the hot water from the shower, closely followed by leaving your wet laundry in the washing machine, your dirty dishes in the sink, or refusing to take out the trash.\nTrying to live peacefully in a house full of sleep walkers, gum chewers, and late-into-the-night phone talkers gives you a fresh taste of the sinful (and sometimes gross) nature of humanity. The best thing you can do to navigate the awkwardness of shared living is to establish some house rules. For example, my current roommate’s responsibilities include mice and anything furry, while my expertise includes bugs and anything slimy. If we use up the last roll of paper towels or eat the last piece of chocolate, we replace them. The list can go on and on, but the longer it gets, it becomes less about individual actions, and more about the type of home we want to live in.\nThe same is true in Exodus 22 and 23, as we find one statement after another regarding things the people of God should or shouldn’t do, and when or how they should do them. It’s a long list, but those two whole chapters can be summed up in four words: “Be my holy people” (Exodus 22:31).\nYou see, issues like honesty and justice are tough to discern on their own, much less when combined with a temporary world that guarantees brokenness and imperfection. Yet, God teaches us that honesty and justice are foundational to the shoring up of our earthly homes.\nWhen you read these two chapters, consider that each sentence is revealing something about God’s heart for His people. He has already paid our debt, given us a listening ear, granted us forgiveness, and fully satisfied our hearts. God’s heart is for restoration and redemption, and the vehicles He uses are honesty and justice.\nSpeak up for those who have no voice,\nfor the justice of all who are dispossessed\nSpeak up, judge righteously,\nand defend the cause of the oppressed and needy.\n—Proverbs 31:8-9\nThank the Lord, for He is honest and just. Amen.\n\n",

She was the sister I never had. With a bandana, we tied our wrists together and proclaimed ourselves “blood sisters.” We didn’t dare cut ourselves, but in our imaginations her “blood” ran through my veins and mine through hers. Archaic as it seemed, we believed that blood would unite us in an unbreakable way.\nWhat I grasped better as a child than I do as an adult is that blood is more than physical cells. In our Western world, we generally view blood as a way to test and treat disease or a way to dramatize a movie. We are so far removed from a sacrificial culture that we struggle to see the true power of this red liquid.\n In the age of Moses, the people understood that blood could sanctify and blood could bind. Don’t miss what truly happened when Moses took the sacrificial blood and threw half of it on the altar and half of it on the leaders of the people. This was not a scene from a horror movie or a superficial gesture. This was the moment the people of Israel had been waiting for. With the sprinkling of blood, the God of grace and the people of slavery were united. “Moses took the blood, splattered it on the people, and said, ‘This is the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you’” (Exodus 24:8).\nThe fallen people have always needed a way to be right with the perfect Lord. Throughout the ages, God has graciously provided different ways and covenants to commune with His people. In the Old Testament, we see animal sacrifices, rules, and promises, and we might be tempted to think it’s outdated. But even today we need a mediator to access our Holy God. \nIn this Lenten season, we prepare to celebrate a new covenant that God made with His people. Unlike the time of Moses, it is now Jesus who intercedes on our behalf with the Father. Rather than oxen blood thrown on an altar and our leaders, it is the blood of Christ that cleanses our sins and binds us to the Lord. Just as I once wanted blood to transform my friend into a sister, the blood of Christ truly transforms us into God’s children.\nAs daughters of the King, we are blessed to be able to commune with the Lord at any moment. This access is made possible only through the new covenant of Christ. As we prepare for Easter, may we remember the power and beauty in the blood that Jesus shed for us. \n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 26:1-37, Genesis 3:24, Hebrews 9:6-14\nWhy does Exodus include the building blueprints for a tent? \nThis is a question worth asking, because the “tabernacle”—a portable tent that would serve as God’s dwelling place—seems like only an artifact of history. Thousands of years later, we no longer need a tabernacle or temple in order to connect with God. Instead, God has come near to each and every one of us. Through Christ, we have unlimited access to Him.\nSo, why does Scripture include these instructions, which may seem a bit obsolete? \nWhile it might be tempting to skim over this passage as a relic of a bygone era, we would miss something important if we did. The truth is, Exodus does not simply contain the blueprint of a historical artifact; it contains the blueprint of history. \nWithin the instructions for building the tabernacle, we discover tiny clues pointing to God’s plan for humankind, a plan for redemption. One of the clues that foreshadows this unfolding is the inclusion of “cherubim” in the design. The curtains were to depict images of these heavenly beings, who had made only one other appearance in the Old Testament: the garden of Eden. In Genesis 3:24, “cherubim” were stationed outside the garden to prevent people from ever re-entering it. \nThe garden of Eden was the last time in history when God and humans dwelt together. Because of sin, that intimacy and fellowship was disrupted. But God had a plan to repair it, and the tabernacle was a part of that plan. By including cherubim in His design for the tabernacle, God was hinting in a particular direction. He was, in short, reversing the fall. He was restoring our broken relationship, and allowing us to enter His presence once again.\nIn his writings on the tabernacle, theologian N.T. Wright refers to this as a “signpost.” The tabernacle was pointing to the temple, and the temple was pointing to Jesus, who would eventually “tabernacle” among us (John 1:14). In other words, the tabernacle was a foretaste of “God come near,” and a foreshadowing of God’s restoration of creation.\nAll of that is tucked into these seemingly obscure instructions for the tabernacle. They belong to the great arc of redemption, which God had only begun to unveil. All along, God was orchestrating a cosmic reversal to overcome the consequences of our sin, and He left all sorts of bread crumbs along the way. \nWoven into these instructions was a plan to save the world, but the instructions tell us something else too. They tell us about God’s character. The God of the tabernacle is a sovereign God, a faithful God, a God of resurrection, who is working all things together for His will (Romans 8:28). He is a God who wrote redemption into the seemingly mundane details and instructions for the building of the tabernacle, and we can trust He is doing the same in our lives today.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Jessica Lamb\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 27:1-21, Zechariah 4:1-14, Revelation 11:1-4  \nIn my grandmother’s home, there is no set time for meals. All waking hours are considered appropriate for the one all-day meal of grazing. If you are spotted without a plate in your hands, she furrows her brow and inquires with concern if you need someone to fix you a plate from the options on her table. On one visit, I slipped into the kitchen at 6:30 in the morning to find plates of fried chicken, mashed potatoes, okra, my favorite vegetable soup, and a chocolate cake already laid out as she stood by the stove frying leftover ham and scrambling eggs for breakfast.\nIn her ninety-three years, she’s experienced more lean seasons than seasons of plenty. She is at rest only when she knows every person in her presence is full—preferably without experiencing even a moment of hunger pangs. Filling us physically is her gift of comfort and affection.\nWe see a glimpse of what it means to be spiritually filled in these readings about the lampstand oil today. The priests are instructed to fill the lampstand with pure oil regularly in order to keep it burning. The lampstand, in doing the work of providing light to the tabernacle, also served as a constant reminder of God’s presence.\nThis picture of a lampstand is one Scripture returns to again and again. Jesus says He is the light of the world and gives the same responsibility to His followers (John 8:12; Matthew 5:14). The Apostle Paul describes us as children of the light, a reflection of Christ through the work of His Spirit (Ephesians 5:8).\nWe are meant to be small lights twinkling in a dark world. But I fail at this on my own, often. A biting retort to someone I love, frustration with my toddler trying to put on her shoes, indifference toward the struggles of a friend. When prayer feels worthless, or when love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control seem like futile options against so much darkness.\nThe instructions for the lampstand in Exodus 25 describe seven bowls shaped like almond blossoms with wicks placed in them. This isn’t a candelabra. The fire in this lampstand kept burning because it was filled regularly with oil from an outside source, not from burning its own wax like a candle.\n“Not by strength or by might, but by my Spirit,” says the LORD of Armies.\n—Zechariah 4:6\nThese words in Zechariah remind us again that the source of the light is not us.The Lord shares a picture here of limitless oil, in the form of two olive trees, flowing straight from the source to directly fuel the lampstand. He tells Zechariah that this is the work of the Spirit.\nWe aren’t replenished by our own strength, or by our own might, but by the Spirit. We have access to what we need in the Spirit; we have fuel from the source. We have this gift from the true Priest who constantly fills us. As we are filled with His Spirit, we become more and more reflective of Jesus. We slowly begin to see the fruit of His faithful, everyday presence and the influence of His light in our lives.\nNot by strength or by might, but by the Spirit.\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 28:1-29, Ezekiel 44:15-19, Ezekiel 44:23-29, 1 Peter 2:4-5\nI’m not married, and I’m not getting married any time soon, but I think about my wedding dress a lot.\nNot in a weird way. And from what I’ve gathered from my married friends, I know that if I do get married someday, I won’t think much about the dress on the actual day anyway. But as a twenty-something girl raised in the South, I’ve been attending a lot of weddings lately, and inevitably, they lead to dreams about my own. \nI think it says a lot that we take the time to get dressed up to partake in this covenantal ceremony before God. The bride, the groom, the wedding party, and the guests—everyone puts on their Sunday best to celebrate. \nIn Exodus 28, God gives Moses intricate instructions for how to make the clothes that his brother, Aaron, will wear as priest. The entire chapter is full of beautiful descriptions of the garments that the artisans are instructed to create. God tells Moses that these garments should be made for Aaron and his sons “for glory and beauty” (v. 2). \nThe priests were mediators between God and the Israelites. They were the only ones allowed to enter into the holy place of the tabernacle, God’s sanctuary, where His spirit dwelt (Ezekiel 44:16). \nIt is fitting, then, that the instructions for the priestly garments are so detailed and delicate. The clothes the priest wore to enter into the presence of God deserved the utmost beauty, the utmost glory. The priests were set apart from the rest of the Israelites to be called holy. The garments they wore should have been their Sunday best.\nI wonder if Aaron and the other priests were giddy with excitement to enter into the presence of God. I wonder if they felt the weight of their responsibility every time they put on these garments—the responsibility to be set apart as holy, as God is holy (Leviticus 19:2).\nGod’s holiness is always connected to glory and beauty. His holiness is stunning. As God’s people, we are called to be holy, too.\nThanks to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, we are able to come before God without wearing the intricate garments of the priests (1 Peter 2:4-5). Christ clothes us in righteousness and gives us the ability to participate in the royal priesthood of the kingdom of God. May we live each day in the glory and beauty given to us by Christ.\n\nEllen Taylor was born and raised in sweet home Alabama, but has called Nashville home since 2013.

    "devo_title": "Instructions for Consecration",
    "devo_summary": "\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 29:1-46, Psalm 132:12-16, Hebrews 7:23-28\nI once spent a summer cleaning bathrooms at a Christian youth camp. A few other girls and I made up the cleaning crew and we followed the same routine every day with every bathroom. My adolescent self was amazed to discover that no matter how well we cleaned a bathroom one day, just as much cleaning was required the next. And though I would be leaving after a month, as long as there were campers around, the bathrooms would always need cleaning. It was a job with no end in sight.\nIn Exodus 29, Moses receives instructions for the daily role of the priests: “This is what you are to offer regularly on the altar every day: two year-old lambs. In the morning offer one lamb, and at twilight offer the other lamb” (vv. 38-39). This offering atoned for the people’s sin. The Hebrew word used to describe this type offering is tamid, which means perpetually or continually—“always.” This makes sense, considering there is always more sin to be atoned for, always more mess that must be cleaned up. This passage describes a job with no end in sight.\nPerforming the same task every day without a weekend or a day off creates the type of monotony that can lead to hopelessness. Even as you are faithful to the work, you wonder, Will it ever be enough? Will I ever get a break?\nThis is why I love the finality of the author of the book of Hebrews’s language when he says of Jesus, “He doesn’t need to offer sacrifices every day, as high priests do—first for their own sins, then for those of the people. He did this once for all when He offered Himself” (Hebrews 7:27). Christ did what every high priest before Him could not do: He took the place of the lamb. He played the role of both priest and sacrifice, and in offering Himself on the altar, He put a stop to the cycle. He ended the monotony. Jesus was enough, and only He was enough because only He was “holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens” (v. 26). \nAt the end of Exodus 29, God explains to Moses the reasoning behind the consecration ritual of the temple and the priests when He says, “I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God. And they will know that I am Yahweh their God, who brought them out of the Land of Egypt, so that I might dwell among them” (vv. 45-46). God is always moving toward His people. Drawing near. Freeing the Israelites from captivity in Egypt. Freeing us from the captivity of our sin.\nLife is full of daily, monotonous tasks, reasons to give up hope, jobs with no end in sight. But the gospel tells a contrary story, one in which the most hopeless part of us is made new and a future glory made possible, all because we know that Christ has died, Christ is risen, and Christ will come again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 30:1-38, 2 Corinthians 2:14-16, 1 John 2:24-27 \nFor years now, my mother has worn patchouli. \nIt smells like the woods, with a tinge of smoke and a hint of something floral. Even days after she’s visited Nashville, her invisible signature lingers on the pillow where she slept, on the scarf she borrowed, on the blanket on the couch—reminding me that we were together. I’m not sure if I love the fragrance, or if I love that it reminds me of her. But I do know this: when I smell patchouli in a store, it doesn’t smell the same as does when it’s on my mom.\nIn Exodus 30, the Lord outlines a series of rich, holy, and sacred instructions for the altar of the tabernacle. He includes a recipe for anointing oil and a recipe for incense. I don’t know about you, but in the age of essential oil popularity, the thought occurred to me that I could probably whip up a batch, just to see what it smelled like. But it’s clear through His instructions that these items are meant to be special. They’re exclusive and not to be shared far and wide; they are recipes never to be mixed outside of the church. “Do not make any incense with this formula for yourselves; consider it holy to the Lord” (v. 37). God is ensuring that the only time His people will smell these rich fragrances is in His presence.\nPsychologists have found that our sense of smell is closely linked with memory. Perhaps that’s why, when I think of my grandmother, I can still remember the tart scent of her cold cream that she’d pat on her face every night. It’s why at Christmas, I stock up on Balsam Fir candles, to extend the season just a bit longer. Fragrance is a powerful force. It helps us remember. It activates emotion. It recalls stories. It brings us back. It transports us. It slows us down. It comforts. \nGod knows this. He knows our spiritual as well as our physiological needs—because He created every part of us, including our sense of smell. Isn’t it beautiful to consider that God wants to activate all of our senses as we interact with Him? He isn’t limited to the spiritual realm, but wants our physical bodies to experience His presence, too. \nJust like my mother’s patchouli oil leaves a trace, as followers of Jesus, we carry the fragrance of Christ with us everywhere we go. “For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing” (2 Corinthians 2:15). Priests no longer have to whip up a batch of something sacred; because of Christ’s work on the cross, now we ourselves are sacred. \nAs you go about your day, pay attention to the sweet smell of that apple, the bitter fragrance of coffee, the grassy scent of sweat on your children. Even in life’s mundane moments, our sense of smell can remind us of our God and His extravagance.\n\nClaire Gibson is a writer whose work has been featured in publications including The Washington Post and Entrepreneur Magazine among many others.

Knot after knot, I’m learning to knit. My mom recently took up the craft, so I asked her to teach me. The older I get, the more I begin to realize all she has taught me over the years. From the things I find funny, to the way I measure flour, and from my slightly defensive (i.e., aggressive) driving habits, to the way I converse at a dinner party—I see her touch on every facet of my life.\nEach thing my mom has taught me throughout my life is truly a gift, some of which I’m just now beginning to appreciate. Hopefully, each of us has had someone who has guided and touched our lives in this way, be it a parent, teacher, mentor, or friend.\nThese dear people can pass on great gifts of wisdom, love, and inspiration. What’s so beautiful about these relationships and the many gifts, talents, and skills they bestow, is that they give us a taste of God’s love. When Jesus spoke to the crowds, He made it clear that our Father in heaven gives even greater gifts to those who ask (Matthew 7:11).\nWe catch an early glimpse of the Father’s gift-giving heart in our Old Testament reading for today. In the midst of outlining the intricate structures that needed to be built for keeping the covenant, we see God breathing His Spirit into the craftsman, Bezalel.\nThe Lord gave His people the huge task of building a holy place for Him to dwell. They were instructed to craft the tent of meeting, ark of the testimony, mercy seat, altar, holy garments, and more. I can only imagine how overwhelming it might have been to receive those blueprints from God. But the Lord did not leave His people without help. He filled Bezalel “with the Spirit of God, with ability and intelligence, with knowledge and all craftsmanship” and “gave all able men ability” to create what God commanded (Exodus 31:3,6).\nEach and every time God commanded His people to act in His name, He also equipped them. Here we see a picture of a God who wants His people to succeed in the co-creation of beautiful and sacred things. He is not testing the artisans, hoping to prove their weakness. He is calling the artisans, eager to aid their victory.  \nThe same holds true for all who follow Jesus today. If God has called you to something, He will equip you for it. Isn’t that amazing? So often we wish the world would be different. We pray for the kingdom of heaven to come, but we don’t realize that God has given us the skills, wisdom, and the Spirit to help build His kingdom here on Earth.\nGod used Bezalel and the skilled artisans to build His temple, not because He needed them, but because He wanted them to participate in His mission. The Lord delights in allowing His children to be co-laborers in kingdom work (1 Corinthians 3:9). Wherever you feel God calling you to help build His kingdom, ask the Lord to equip you. You have a generous Father in heaven who is waiting to help you carry out His work.\n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 32:1-35, 1 Kings 12:26-28\nI love browsing through my childhood photographs with my daughters. It brings me such joy to watch their facial expressions as they grapple with the realization that their Mommy was once a little girl just like them. We compare hairstyles, shoes, and favorite poses. I share the stories and memories of each photo, and inevitably, we laugh at how much I’ve changed. \nEvery once in a while, when the laughter settles, the reality hits me that the little girl in the photographs had no idea of the future her heavenly Father had in store for her. I wish I could look my younger self in the eyes and tell her so many things. Mostly, I wish she would have believed God’s Word and used it as the foundation of her actions and the blueprint for her future. \nThere is just no doubt about it: God’s Word is true and every word in it is written to teach, lead, protect, encourage, and draw His children into a life with Him. “All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:16-17).\nLike the Israelites at the bottom of Mount Sinai, I can become impatient and choose my own truth to follow. Throughout my life, I have had vivid memories of seasons where God’s Word, His voice, and His presence just seemed too far out of reach. It is in these seasons when my heart wanders; trusting His plan for good in my life becomes harder and harder. \nIt seems harsh, but it’s true: I’ve created golden calves of my own. When God seems far away, it becomes much easier to place my trust, faith, and hope in other things that are seemingly more tangible—my career, marriage, children, or excessive entertainment, just to name a few. This truth makes me even more grateful for God’s grace and the many opportunities He gives me to turn my eyes and heart back toward Him and toward the truth of His Word. \nAnd so even when my heart becomes heavy, when my impatience and anxiousness lead me to believe God’s presence is off somewhere in the distance, God is calling me to remember that He is at work in my life and in all things. He has given us His very real presence in Jesus Christ and the very real truth of His Word. \nAlthough I cannot go back and talk to myself as an impatient teenager, a faltering twenty-something, or an anxious new mother, I choose to remain grateful that God’s Word is true. The tablets Moses brought down to the Israelites “were the work of God, and the writing was God’s writing” (Exodus 32:16). Even now, He is writing a continual story of grace, regardless of our ability to see it in the moment. But as we learn to trust Him more, we find that His grace is never-ending, His forgiveness abounding, and His love unwavering.\n\nWynter Pitts is the founder of For Girls Like You, a resource ministry for both tween girls and their parents.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 33:1-23, Genesis 3:8-10, Numbers 6:22-26\nWhat is your Promised Land? We all have one deep inside us. The roadmap of our hearts leads us there, to the place where our treasure is found—the place where our hope, wonder, and worship reside.\nGod had promised to rescue the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and bring them to a new home, a land of freedom and abundance. But His bigger promise was this: He would bring them back into relationship with Him, back into His presence. He would dwell among the Israelites and be their God (Exodus 29:45-46).\nBut God’s people put all of that in jeopardy by building the golden calf and inciting God’s anger with their idol worship. They were set to experience separation from Him again. Yes, He would still bring them into the Promised Land, but He would not accompany them there (Exodus 33:1-3). \nBecause of their sin, Israel could not be in God’s presence—but Moses could. The Lord spoke to Moses “face to face, as one speaks to a friend” (v.11). And so on behalf of the Israelites, Moses pleaded with God to reconsider:  \n“If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here. How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?” (vv. 15-16).\nMoses knew what was really at stake for the Israelites: the true Promised Land, God Himself. Moses knew that God was not merely a means to an end, not just the path to blessing. God is the blessing. God’s presence was the very identity of His people. If He wasn’t in the new land, then there was no point in going. Without Him, there would be no real blessing, no peace, no rest. \nSo what does your Promised Land look like? \nMine looks like a land of abundant provision, free from shame and fear, melancholy, sickness, and loneliness. But Scripture tells me all of these needs and more are met now, in Jesus, though He is far more than a means to an end. He is Alpha and Omega, beginning and end—and everything in between (Revelation 22:13).\nHe doesn’t just provide. He is our provision (Genesis 22:14).\nHe doesn’t just make us righteous. He is our righteousness (Jeremiah 23:6).\nHe doesn’t just give us a peace. He is our peace (Judges 6:24; Hebrews 13:20).\nHe doesn’t just heal us. He is our healing (Exodus 15:26).\nAnd if we know Jesus, we are never truly alone. He is always with us (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23). His promise to each of us is this: “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest” (Exodus 33:14). \nIt’s in His attributes that God reveals more of Himself to us—more of His character, His nature, and His heart. Like Moses, we can boldly ask to know more of God, to see more of His glory. This is why God delivered the Israelites, and it’s why He sent His Son to deliver us. God came near so we could truly know Him and never be separated from His presence again.\n\nKara Gause is an editor for She Reads Truth happily residing in Nashville, Tennessee.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 34:1-35, John 14:8-11, 2 Corinthians 3:12-18\nI do not own an ice scraper. After all, I have lived in the South my whole life, which means I hold a deep-hearted commitment to sunshine and reject temperatures below 32 degrees. Still, every winter the roads in Tennessee will occasionally ice over and the ground will become covered with snow. On those days, I become so cold I think the logical part of my brain has frozen. It’s then that I almost believe in the magic of a snow day—that is, until I need to go somewhere, note my car’s frozen windshield, and remember the ice scraper situation.\nA credit card or driver’s license is my go-to solution in this scenario, and they work! A little bit, anyway. Just enough to scrape a little peephole on the driver’s side and hope the rest will melt by the time I reach the stoplight on the corner. (Do not try this at home, friends. Maybe just stay off the roads.)\nWe are all navigating life through the tiny peephole of humanity, unable to fully comprehend the perfection of our Creator and see Him as He truly is. Day by day, we may be able to get where we need to go comfortably, forgetting the hundreds of glorious layers we cannot yet see. But when Moses goes to Mount Sinai to speak with the Lord, two stone tablets in hand, he has been chosen as a mediator between God and His people and will experience Him in a very significant way.\nMoses sees “behind” God, taking in as much of His holiness and glory as humanly possible. God reveals parts of His character to Moses that Moses had never seen before, but it was confirmed through what God does next: He renews His covenant with His people. The covenant renewal does not signal a change in God’s heart between the Old Testament and the New Testament. Rather, it proves that He is always faithful. He is still full of compassion. He continues to abound in goodness, forgiveness, and truth. \nAs he descends from Mount Sinai, Moses’ face is radiant—a physical effect from encountering close communion with the glory of God. Onlookers are afraid of the way his face shines, and so he covers it with a veil, “so that the sons of Israel could not look at the end of what was fading away” (2 Corinthians 3:13).\nThe glory of the old covenant was fading away, but God had stored away His promises to His children in the new and better covenant. The old had gone, the new had come, and His mercy extended through it all. The faithfulness of a steady God remained the same.\nToday, you and I probably find ourselves looking at the world through worried peepholes instead of fixing our eyes on God, asking Him to show us His glory in our day-to-day lives. And yet, even though we don’t have an ice scraper to reveal His layers of perfection in the same way, we know we are surrounded by the safety of His covenant. His promises still stand, even for us. Praise the Lord.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 35:1-35, John 10:17-18, Romans 12:1\nOur giving can feel empty sometimes, can’t it? Perhaps it’s because we have been wounded by frenzied sermons on giving or the pulsing belief that if we’re not giving everything, we’re disobeying the demand of a greedy God. Giving can feel like a form of karma; we cross our fingers and hope as we give that it will be given back to us in equal or greater measure. Or it can feel like checking a box, doing our duty as Christians. Or perhaps, we withhold giving to the Lord because we don’t trust Him with our finances, our security, or our portion. \nI have been to all those places. There have been years of my life when I was living paycheck to paycheck, barely scraping by, certain I couldn’t afford to give anything to the Lord. And then other years of my life when I was indifferent to the needs of others. But then, nearly a decade ago, when my check-the-box giving had dwindled to nothing, and my indifference had grown to an insurmountable level, God began to teach me that there was something He wanted far, far more than my money; He wanted my heart and my spirit. \nIn this passage we see the detailed list of what the people of God brought to help build and adorn the tabernacle. Moses is attentive in his communication of what God desired and also what the people gave. This is saying something about God: He cares about the details of our lives, what we can give and what He created us to give. No two gifts are exactly alike. It is as if Moses is saying: your gift matters because you matter to God. He cares about the knitting of your heart and the crafting of your hands, the things you make and the livelihood He’s given you. And because we can know He cares about these things, our hearts are moved by that love and, in obedience to the Spirit inside of us, we can freely give. \nThere’s nothing obligatory or forced about this kind of offering. God alone can move in our heart and prompt our spirit to bring what we have as an offering to Him (Exodus 35:21). We give because He first gave to us. It is not—as some angry preachers shout from lofted pulpits—because we owe God everything, but simply because everything we have is owned already by God. Offering all we have to the Lord is only possible because He already gave everything to us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.\nWhat is in your hands today? How has God uniquely crafted you, knit you together, formed you, and made you? What stirs your heart and your affections for Him? For the Church? For your brothers and sisters? What moves your heart toward God? Give Him the gifts of your heart, your passion, your provision. That’s what He’s asking for: the gift of your delight and cheerful giving.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner. She blogs at Sayable, and tweets and instagrams at @lorewilbert.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 36:1-38, Matthew 27:50-51, Hebrews 9:23-28\n“God doesn’t call the equipped. He equips the called.” \nThis is a popular saying among Christians that, like most popular sayings, is both true and not true. It’s true in the sense that God has a generous track record of calling unlikely, untrained individuals. Shepherds, prostitutes, and unlearned fishermen have all occupied significant roles in the story of God. \nHowever, God also has a track record of calling very equipped people. Moses was raised in a palace under the leadership influence of Pharaoh. The prophet Elisha was discipled by the great prophet Elijah. The Apostle Paul was an expert in the Law, having studied and trained in it since childhood. And Bezalel, Oholiab, and the other builders of the tabernacle were “skilled,” possessing all the “wisdom and understanding to know how to do all the work” (Exodus 36:1).\nThese different stories capture the paradox of calling, which consists of two seemingly conflicting truths:\nOn the one hand, God always provides what we need for the task. Whether it’s talent, training, or a handful of loaves and fishes, God’s provision is sufficient for His purposes. We can trust this to be true, and it should instill us with confidence and peace. \nOn the other hand, we are not sufficient on our own. Moses was trained to be a leader, but he could not summon down plagues. Paul knew the Law, but he relied on the Holy Spirit to deliver understanding. And although the artisans possessed both the talent and the instructions to build the tabernacle, there was nevertheless a lot they didn’t know. They didn’t know what the cherubim should look like. They didn’t know the precise designs of the curtains. They were given a rough sketch, a partial vision, and then expected to construct the rest in faith.\nThat is the tension of calling. God provides us with more than enough (v. 7), but not so much as to free us from dependence on Him. The secret to managing this tension is guarding the focus of our call, which is Christ alone. When we make our calling about us, we swing between insecurity and pride; between fears about our insufficiency, and a greedy clamoring for fame. But when we remember our calling is about Christ, both our inabilities and abilities are granted an appropriate amount of weight.\nWe see this balance in the building of the tabernacle: skilled workers, equipped with enough, relying on God for the rest of the vision, and doing it all for the glory of God. They had what they needed, but they never stopped needing God. Our own callings should look the same. We can step into God’s purpose, radiating confidence, while humbly pointing others to the source of it: our all-sufficient Savior.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 37:1-29, Jeremiah 1:11-12, Revelation 1:12-20\nI lived in England for a year after college. Before I moved there, I did not fully understand that an English winter involved very little sunlight. The sun rose late and was completely gone by 4 p.m. This was incredibly disheartening for a girl raised in the sunny desert of South Texas. I remember feeling as if winter would never end.\nIn Exodus 37, the careful crafting of the lampstand, and the ark with its mercy seat, gave the Israelites hope for the light that was to come. Fashioned from a solid piece of gold, the stem and six branches of the lampstand held seven perpetually burning flames that not only illuminated the holy place of the tabernacle, but also flickered in anticipation of the coming light of Christ.\nDarkness to light, darkness to light. This is the cycle we see in nature, and this is the cycle we see throughout the narrative of Scripture. This is why the ever-burning light from the lampstand was so critical.\nFor the disciples, the days after Jesus’ death must have felt like a winter that would never end. Three days of confusion and despair. Their rabbi, their friend, their Savior, had died.\nAlthough I know the end of this story and the hope that Christ’s resurrection would bring in three days’ time, I still feel the weight of darkness on a daily basis. I still feel like this life has more winters than it does summers. For this reason, I need to remember the words that Jesus said to John in the book of Revelation: \n“I am the First and the Last, the Living One. I was dead, but look—I am alive forever and ever…”\n– Revelation 1:17-18\nSomething else I didn’t know about England was that what winter lacked in light, summer made up for tenfold. In summer, the sun rose early and didn’t fully set until 10 p.m. People stayed out later, and walked in the parks more often, their coats left hanging on their hooks. A warmth gripped the city that thawed any remnant of winter.\nI wonder if this is what it felt like when the disciples saw Jesus alive. How quickly their winter must have turned to summer, their despair to hope, their sadness to joy. This is what the light of Christ did for the disciples. This is what it does for us in our daily lives, and this is what it will do when Christ comes again.\nThe promise Jesus gave John in Revelation also came with an instruction: “Therefore, write what you have seen, what is, and what will take place after this” (v. 19). Until Christ comes again, the Church has taken on the responsibility of the lampstand. We don’t sit and wait idly for Christ to return. We are the flame that continues to burn. How will we take up the charge? How will we tell others of what we have seen? How will we tell them of what is, and what is to come?\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 38:1-31, Psalm 51:14-17, Hebrews 10:1-14\nMy husband and I like to joke that, from 2012 to 2015, we were exiled to the Midwest. In truth, we loved our time in two new states, but our hearts longed to be home in Nashville with our friends and family. But graduate school and a new job took us to Missouri and then Kentucky, and by the time we limped bleary-eyed and empty back to Nashville, by the grace of God and a few new opportunities, we were ready to set down permanent roots. \nSo we decided to build a house. It took months and a million decisions. (Do you have any idea how much grout is in your house? A lot. And we had to decide the colors of all of it.) But when we finally moved in, we knew we were home. We carefully chose each detail to create what is, to us, our ideal home. The kitchen floors are resilient hardwood, designed to handle two kiddos and a crazy cat. We chose carpet for the stairs so when we run up and down them a hundred times a day, we don’t risk a fall. Thoughtful, intentional, and reflective of our family’s particular brand of chaos—this is our home. \nI have a tendency to skim over these pages in Exodus because I’m not sure all of these details really matter. Does knowing that the pots on the altar of the tabernacle were made of bronze really help me draw closer to God? \nThere are no wasted words in the Word of God; every detail reveals something glorious. Even when the details seem incredibly minor, they matter. There is a rich theology of the building of the tabernacle, and it is woven through these passages about bronze and gold and linen. \nThe writer of Exodus used the Hebrew word Mishkan, which means “tabernacle” or “dwelling place.” The tabernacle was not just a mobile house of worship where the Israelites could come to offer sacrifices to God; it was the literal dwelling place of the Lord among His people. And so, unlike the half-dozen different shades of grout for my new house, every detail of building the tabernacle really matters. Every detail reveals its holy purpose. Thoughtful, intentional, reflective of God’s glory and His promise to dwell among his people—the tabernacle was God’s home. \nThe Israelites built the tabernacle with bronze, silver, and gold. The outer areas were bronze, and the holy of holies (where God Himself dwells) was constructed of gold, the most precious of metals. God’s holiness was evident at every turn, drawing His people to Him. \nEventually, God would come to dwell with His people in flesh and bone. John 1 tells us that the Word would become flesh and tabernacle (dwell) among us (vv. 1-2)—a far more precious thing in His sight than even the most valuable metals and cloths. \nFrom the garden of Eden to the tabernacle in the desert, from Solomon’s temple in Jerusalem to the flesh and blood of Jesus, from our modern sanctuaries to the promised new heaven and new earth—God’s desire to dwell among His people is clear. It is His heart’s desire. May it be ours as well.\n\nMelanie Rainer is a bookworm from birth who makes her days writing, editing, and reading in Nashville, Tennessee.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Exodus 39:1-43, Psalm 110:1-4, Hebrews 5:1-10\nI believe with all my heart that these detailed descriptions of the construction of the tabernacle in Exodus are as much the inspired Word of God as my favorite psalm. But for a free-spirited, color-outside-the-lines kind of girl like me, the sheer number of details recorded in these chapters gives me flashbacks to my freshman accounting class.  \nWhy did the Lord instruct Moses to build altars and tables, lampstands and basins, tunics and turbans with such extreme attention to detail? Why were these details recorded so meticulously? All these centuries later, what do they have to teach us about the character of God and our relationship with Him?\nLet’s zero in for a moment on Exodus 39, where we find the description of the priestly garments. This was more than a garment. With gold and stones, bells and crowns, this was an ensemble made to take our breath away. But why? Aaron’s robes weren’t designed to turn heads at Fashion Week. They wouldn’t be sold to the highest bidder. So why was such detailed extravagance needed? \nPeel away the layers, and we find the answer in a single thread. The scarlet thread mentioned over and over in Exodus 39 is the same thread that is stitched throughout all of God’s Word. It is the thread God used to sew together garments of grace for Adam and Eve after the fall (Genesis 3:21). It is the thread that signaled salvation from Rahab’s window (Joshua 2:18). And most significantly, we see it at the cross, as trails of blood stream down our Savior’s face as evidence of His atonement for our sins. \nAaron’s priestly garments were woven with red thread, a picture of the gospel illustrated by the thread of salvation woven throughout all of God’s Word. The weight of the robe covered with stones was symbolic of the burden of sin; as Aaron slipped it on, I imagine its heaviness reminded him of the weight of his own sin and of ours. The crown on the priest’s head was a shadow of the crown of salvation purchased for us at Christ’s cross. \nThe garment maker couldn’t have known it, but he was preaching the gospel. Stitch by meticulous stitch, he was proclaiming salvation was near. Through the lens of the cross we see these extravagant robes showcase an extravagant gospel. \nIt’s possible the craftsmen tasked with the minutiae of the tabernacle felt overwhelmed and even belabored by the tedium of so many details. Obedience can often feel like that. As we shepherd our own children, or serve in other often thankless ways, or pull out our Bibles listening for God’s voice again and again, there are times when we all wonder, Why does all of this matter? \nThe answer rarely seems to come in the moment, but in hindsight we see that routine obedience to the Lord always reveals the gospel thread. He is using our seemingly small acts of surrender to transform these filthy rags into robes of righteousness. As we trust and obey, we can look back and sigh with gratitude, saying, “as the LORD had commanded, so [we have] done it” (Exodus 39:43).\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

I read about this happening to some of B’s fans several years ago. Apparently, when Beyoncé heard two ladies singing her song in the booth next-door, she decided to join them. I think I would have died.\nOur culture is obsessed with celebrities. I would say I care less about famous people than most, but I still get excited if I see a fancy person in the airport. There is something about how untouchable they seem that makes us commoners lose our minds in their presence. But if we get tongue-tied around a successful singer, imagine how awe-struck would we be in the presence of the God of the universe. The thing is, God does show up to the party throughout history. The Lord loves to be with the people He created. \nFrom the very beginning, God made a world in which He dwelt with His people. That was His original design. God walked in the garden with Adam and Eve (Genesis 3:8). But the fall of mankind fractured that fellowship, and a perfect God could not commune with imperfect people. \nGod devised a sanctuary so He could be near the people He loved.  As soon as the tabernacle of Israel was completed, the glory of the Lord rushed in (Exodus 40:34). \nIt would have been incredible for the Israelites to see the cloud over the tent of meeting and know their God was with them. They moved when God moved and rested when God rested, in a harmony they’d never experienced before. But of course it didn’t last; broken people always find a way of breaking intimacy with God. \nThe Father had no intention of giving up on His children. He sent His Son to dwell with them in flesh and blood. Again we destroyed the sanctuary of God’s presence. Yet, despite our failings, God had a greater plan all along: resurrection.\nAs we look toward the Easter resurrection, we prepare to celebrate God’s great act of restoring fellowship with Him. Though we are far from worthy and have broken relationship with Him at every turn, the Lord in His grace set things right. The Bible is a story of God’s commitment to save the people He loves. Through the resurrection of Christ, we will one day be raised to finally dwell in the full glory of God (Revelation 21:3).\n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

The sight of it always makes me breathe in deep and slow, exhaling with relief at the beauty. \nWe are transitioning from winter to spring here in Nashville, but the transition has been bumpy at best: 70 and sunny one day, 30 and snowing the next. The trees have begun to bloom and the birds have started their singing, and I refuse to take my puffy coat back out of the closet even though the temperature merits it. \nThis morning when I drove past the lake it was 35 degrees outside. The spring sun was especially bright, and I squinted as it shone through my driver’s side window. A dense layer of fog covered the water as far as I could see. Gulls danced in and out of the cloud-like mist, some resting still and peaceful on the glassy surface. The sun, the fog, the gulls, the water—the combination stunned me, caught that deep sigh in my chest and held it there a minute. It was the second day in a row the lake looked exactly like this, and both times it brought worship to my lips. \nI praise you, Lord, for you are the Creator God, the maker of the water and the birds, the sun and the mist, and the breath in my lungs. You are God, you are Lord, and I give you all of me today. \nThere was no analyzing my prayer outline or word choice, no time for false pretense or doubt. I’d seen a glimpse of the glory of the Lord, and immediate, unhindered praise felt like the only possible response.\nSpontaneous worship sessions are not new to our Almighty God. Since the making of mankind and the dawn of creation, people and nature have praised Him. On this day recorded in Luke 19, Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey, and another chorus of praise erupted: \nBlessed is the King who comes\nin the name of the Lord.\nPeace in heaven\nand glory in the highest heaven! (v.38)\nLuke tells us “the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen” (v.37). Miracles—plural. Many of them. These people who had been following Jesus knew this was not just a man. This man was the Son of God. They had seen a glimpse of His glory, and it led them to worship.\nAs Jesus rode on toward the gates of Jerusalem that day—toward the death due every single human but Him—He wept for its brokenness. He lamented the devastation that would come because the people did not recognize the Messiah in their midst (v.44).  \nAs we enter Holy Week, may we see Jesus for who He is. May we read with clear eyes and open hearts the Gospel accounts of these days and events that are the foundation of our faith. And may we worship the One at the center of it all. By God’s goodness and grace, let it never be said of us: “You did not recognize the time when God visited you” (v.44).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Mark 11:12-19, Isaiah 56:1-8\nI have always wanted to see the Grand Canyon, run a marathon, eat vegetarian, and be the kind of woman who cleans and cooks on a regular, rotating schedule. I’m putting these things off until I’m less busy with children, and work, and hassling my husband about his beard. (It’s a full time job.) There is a reason why we all resolve to live our lives slightly differently every year, and there’s a reason none of us make all these grand, global changes all at once. It’s because we’re human.\nOur lives are built in seasons. We all go through seasons of pain, growth, contentment, and right now, I think my family is in a season of noise. Is that a season? Goodness, there is simply so much volume right now. But I know it will pass, the children will eventually leave, and we will come to a quieter and lonelier season.\nTwice in this very short passage from Mark, I noticed that Jesus is speaking and there is someone who hears Him. The first is in chapter 11 when He curses the fig tree, saying, “‘May no one ever eat fruit from you again!’ And his disciples heard it” (v. 14). The second follows just after He cleanses the temple, declaring that it has been turned into a den of thieves, and “the chief priests and the scribes heard it…” (v. 18).\nAn easy first response to this passage is to assume that Jesus is very grouchy with the fig tree and the folks running the temple, but obviously there’s more going on here. He is bringing judgment to Israel. The fig tree failed to bear fruit, and the leaders failed to protect the temple. In both cases, when Jesus speaks with pronouncement of judgment, someone hears it—first the disciples and then the chief priests and the scribes.\nJesus is not just proclaiming judgment; He is proclaiming final judgment. There is a season for repentance, and that season is now (Mark 1:15). Salvation is now at hand, and now is the time to repent. Jesus isn’t calling His disciples and the chief priests to plan on repenting, to resolve to repent later, when they are less busy or when they have more money or when the kids are older. He is calling them to repent now; we are not promised tomorrow.\nWhen we hear judgment, there are only two responses. The disciples heard it. The chief priests heard it. They could either choose to follow Him or choose to reject Him. It’s so stark and shocking to look honestly at what Jesus is calling all of us to do: to walk in the way of life or to go the way of death.\nIt simplifies all the other seasons of life if I know that first and foremost, there are only two ways to respond when we hear Christ speaking: walk in the way of judgment or the way of repentance.\nThe good news is that Christ has come to clean out our thieving hearts, and make them hearts of prayer. The signs of the fig tree and the temple cleansing are both reminders that God is making a people for Himself, that He has brought salvation to us. He gathers His own to Himself in all seasons.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 21:1-38, Luke 22:1-2, Daniel 7:13-14\nI love the television comedy Parks and Recreation for a hundred reasons. I love it for its heart, humor, absurdity, characters—I could go on and on about it, but I’ll save my fangirl essay for another day. Instead, I want to talk about one episode in particular from season four: “The End of the War.” In this episode, a group of “zorpies” (the nickname given to a group of cult-like doomsdayers) reserve a park for what they believe will be the last night of the world when their lizard-god Zorp returns to destroy Earth. Of course, the world doesn’t end, and so they reserve the park again for when they think Zorp will really come back. \nThe episode is a parody of any number of real doomsday groups, who gain popularity in the news when they think the world is going to end based on a complex calculation of prophecy, astronomy, and who knows what else. We have a tendency to laugh off these groups—especially the ones who claim Christianity—as harmless and wacky, which most of them are. But when I read this passage in Luke 21, I have to wrestle with my own “end of the world” questions. \nJesus is speaking in what is known today as the Olivet Discourse, a series of teachings He gave while on the Mount of Olives. It is also recorded in Matthew and Mark, the other synoptic Gospels. And it happens to be one of the most controversial and debated teachings of Jesus. \nIn this passage, Jesus foretells destruction and challenge, wars and natural disasters. But His refrain is clear: “do not be terrified” (v. 9); “not a hair of your head will perish” (v. 18); “your redemption is drawing near” (v. 28); “my words will not pass away” (v. 33). \nEven if, as many scholars believe, these specific prophecies were fulfilled when the Romans destroyed the temple in AD 70, we can still relate to the feelings of fear as we wait for Jesus to return. We can also feel the anxious heartbeat of the ancient Israelites who dealt with destruction and war as they waited for their Messiah. And yet through the ages, one truth remains that all God’s people cling to: Christ has died, Christ is risen, Christ will come again. \nRevelation 21 promises us a new heaven and new earth, and it assures us that those words are trustworthy and true. We do not know if and how the world will end or when and how Christ will return, but we know that He will. And today, that is enough. \nHis dominion is an everlasting dominion\nthat will not pass away,\nand his kingdom is one\nthat will not be destroyed.\n—Daniel 7:14\n\nMelanie Rainer is a bookworm from birth who makes her days writing, editing, and reading in Nashville, Tennessee.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Mark 14:3-11, Matthew 26:14-16, Luke 22:3-6, Zechariah 11:12-13\nI have always found sacrificing comes easily for me. It is the keeping of a good thing that feels so tenuous. I am always positive God is going to ask for the precious things, the most precious things, and so before I can be disappointed by their abrupt departure, I toss them into what I perceive to be His hands. Take my life, take all I am and all I will be, all I have and will have, is my oft-whispered prayer. This exercise, though, is less noble than it sounds at first—more the actions of a pauper unaccustomed to God’s goodness than a daughter of the Most High God. \nWhat does it mean to hold on to a thing until the act of pouring it out is actually noble, actually costly? Even if the thing itself is held dear or is worth much, what does it mean to reserve it for the essence of its purpose instead of wasting it in dribbles and drops like a careless child carrying a cup of milk? How do we know what the difference between wasting a thing and pouring out a thing is, especially when they look so much the same? \nThe answer to all of these questions lies not in the vial of costly perfume nor the woman in this story, but in the Man over whose head she poured herself: Jesus, the perfect, all-sufficient, timely sacrifice, the one of greatest cost, greatest worth, and greatest value, pouring Himself out over the soon to die, decaying flesh of humankind. \nThis act of nobility Jesus pointed to was to redirect the incredulous gaze of the disciples for whom nobility looked like the rule and reign of an earthly king. Jesus wanted to show, once again, that nobility in the kingdom of heaven was the opposite of the expected norms. This broken woman pouring her broken flask over the soon to be broken body of her Savior—this is the way of the kingdom of God, Jesus was saying. Hers is a true act of generosity. “She has done a noble thing for me,” He tells them (Mark 14:6).\nGod saved His precious expression of Himself in flesh for the most opportune moment, the best moment. He saved the costliest offering for the moment of maximum impact. The Bible says, “At the right time Christ died for the ungodly” (Romans 5:6). As this woman poured her alabaster flask over the head of her Savior, we are shown a picture of the emptying of a good thing for the best one, the greatest exchange: Christ’s death for our life.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: John 16:16-24, John 16:32-33, Mark 14:12-72, Psalm 41:7-13, Zechariah 13:7\nOf all the betrayals of Jesus, Peter’s is the hardest for me to stomach. Peter, the one who was first to claim Jesus as the Messiah. Peter, who got out of the boat to walk on water to meet his Savior. Then, after all they had been through, it is Peter who denies he ever knew Christ. One minute Christ is his Messiah, and the next? Someone he didn’t want to be associated with.\nI’ll never forget the deep shame I felt when I did something similar to a friend in college. To her face, I acted as if she were my best friend. But behind her back, I said something to the contrary. She heard about it. I heard that she heard about it. And then I was sick.\nThis is why Peter’s story is so difficult for me to stomach. I see a lot of myself in it. Not only in the way I’ve denied friends, but the times I’ve denied Christ too. Proclaiming Him as my Savior one minute, acting as if I don’t even know Him the next. Peter denied Christ three times, but I’ve denied Him countless times.\nJesus was not surprised—not by Peter’s denial, nor by mine. In fact, He predicted it during the Last Supper. Quoting the prophet Zechariah, He said, “All of you will run away, because it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’ But after I have been resurrected, I will go ahead of you to Galilee” (Mark 14:27-28).\nAfter He says this, who pipes up first? Peter, that’s who, declaring, “Even if everyone runs away, I will certainly not!” (v. 29). But just a few verses later, Peter is shocked at his own hypocrisy. “And he broke down and wept” (v. 72).\nJesus also predicted Peter’s behavior, as well as Peter’s response to that behavior, when He said, “You will become sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn to joy” (John 16:20). How? How could Peter’s weeping ever turn to joy? Even though he would see the risen Christ, wouldn’t that only bring him further shame?\nPerhaps Peter experienced what I experienced with my friend in college. I dreaded facing her again. When I did, eyes to the floor, I apologized. She had all the power in that moment. She could have hurt me right back or told everyone how two-faced I was. But she didn’t. Instead, she looked at me and said, “It’s water under the bridge.” She forgave me. I will never forget that moment of undeserved mercy.\nUndeserved mercy is what Peter received from Jesus. At the end of Mark, when the angel tells Mary Magdalene the good news of the resurrection, the angel also says, “Go, tell the disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you to Galilee; you will see him there just as he told you’” (Mark 16:7). The disciples and Peter. Jesus calls him by name. Peter is still invited to meet the risen Christ.\nIn our times of sorrow, in the depths of sin, when facing the reality of our own hypocrisy, when joy feels absurd, reserved for someone who is “better” than we are—this is the story we ought to remember. We can have joy, not because of who we are or what we have done, but because we are still invited to meet the risen Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Mark 15:1-47, Isaiah 52:13-15; Isaiah 53:1-7\nThe route to a place you’ve never been is always longest the first time. Christ’s journey to the cross was a first. For the Creator of the universe, death was the one place He hadn’t been. The Bible gives us a slowed-down account of His last few hours, allowing us to watch how God acts as He walks toward death.\nJesus spoke very few recorded words in the hours leading to His crucifixion. His silences stand in contrast to the clamouring of the crowds, the indictments of the priests, and shouts of His accusers. In the face of unjust denunciations and undeserved mockery, wouldn’t an ordinary person rise to their own defense and use reason and truth to set the record straight? Isn’t history filled with stories of men and women who stood to give articulate, impassioned defenses for themselves? Isn’t a clear defense the only way to save yourself?\nThen why did Jesus stay so silent the day He was crucified? Jesus’ responses on Good Friday are so shocking. He doesn’t defend Himself. The mockers even jeered at Him, saying, “‘He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him’” (Matthew 27:42).\nIndeed, as they led Him out to the cross, He went meekly, like a lamb to the slaughter (Isaiah 53:7). They falsely accused Him, and yet He uttered not a word. It is funny how we so easily confuse the signs of weakness and the signs of strength. \nGentleness and meekness confuse us, because our hearts are naturally driven to clamor and strive, making a lot of noise in the process. We are stupid and boisterous by nature, making much of all the wrong things, slow to lovingkindness, and abounding in anger. Maybe in the end, what we don’t understand is the humility of obedience—obedience even to the point of death. Instead, we are intent upon asserting ourselves at all costs. The last thing we want is for anyone to step on our selfish toes. And so obedience, totally selfless obedience, is confounding to us. It looks like weakness, like foolishness, and our hearts mock it.\nWe are, left to ourselves, everything we should not be. He is, even as all the world railed against Him, even as He walked straight into death for the first and final time, all that we need.\nBut he was pierced because of our transgressions,\ncrushed because of our iniquities;\npunishment for our peace was on him,\nand we are healed by his wounds.\n—Isaiah 53:5\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 23:54-56, Matthew 27:62-66, Isaiah 53:8-12\nEvery time I visit my hometown, I stop by the grocery store to buy a bouquet of flowers. And just like any good tight-knit community, I usually run into someone I know—an old friend from high school or one of my parents’ coworkers. We’ll catch up on recent happenings and wish each other well, but recently, it’s occurred to me that no one has ever commented on my armful of fresh flowers. Maybe it’s because they don’t notice, but more likely, it’s because they already know what they’re for.\nI had a lot of plans for my young adult life, but becoming familiar with a cemetery was not one of them. My brother was 20 years old when he passed away, which is why it will always seem more appropriate to pay my respects with something from his favorite football team instead of tulips or roses. Yet, I bring them anyway. Others do, too. In fact, the groundskeeper once told me that the hill where my brother is buried is one of the most frequented areas in the cemetery. It’s a strange compliment I never thought I’d have to accept.\nHoly Saturday is the day we acknowledge that things are not as they should be. Sitting between Jesus’ death and resurrection, this is the one day we are absolutely unable to look away from the tension of faith: what has happened and what is to come. Theologians refer to this as the “already and the not yet.” But because we know Christ’s resurrection is coming tomorrow, it’s easy to overlook the sunrise and sunset that took place while He was dead and buried in a tomb.\nWhile we already know this arrangement is temporary, the people of Jerusalem had no way to be sure. It was the day Jesus’ followers had to choose between putting His promises into practice or going back to doubting that He was really the Son of God. But even those who were not His followers were unable to return to business as usual on Holy Saturday. The chief priests who’d crucified Him the day before, certain He was no longer alive, warned Pilate that something strange may be going on with the tomb. “Go and make it as secure as you know how,” Pilate ordered (Matthew 27:65).\nWe cannot deny the significance of death in the gospel story. We usually see this in Jesus’ own experience and eventual defiance of it, but the in-between is important, too. All the pain and the unknown of death is real—so real, that Jesus faced it head-on to reverse its power over us. \nSometimes, it’s enough to know that He has gone before us, even in this. Because Christ lay in His own grave, we get to lay hope on ours. We can acknowledge that things are not as they should be, while still holding onto His promises of redemption.\nLet us gather our grief and hope, disappointment and joy, and wait by His tomb together, for resurrection has been promised to us. Alleluia.\nFor if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death,\nwe will certainly also be in the likeness of his resurrection.\n—Romans 6:5\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 24:1-49, Psalm 16:9-11\nThey had hoped He was the one. But here it was, the third day since Jesus’ crucifixion. And here they were, spices in hand, walking to the tomb to anoint His dead body. \nThey had hoped He was the one, and now they were heartbroken. \nThat same day, two others walked the road from Jerusalem to Emmaus. They were discouraged and dejected, and the tension in their conversation showed it. When a stranger inquired about their trouble, they responded in disbelief. Was this the only person in town who didn’t know what had happened? And so they told Him: a great teacher and prophet had been put to death, and now His body was a missing from the tomb. There were rumors that He was alive, but no one had seen Him. “We were hoping that he was the one who was about to redeem Israel,” they said (Luke 24:21). \nThey had hoped He was the one. What would they do now? \nIf we pause the story here, we can imagine this desperate, disheartening feeling. We know from experience what it feels like to realize our long held hopes have come up empty. We know the sinking feeling that comes with a door not just closed, but bolted shut, the key permanently out of our reach. \nWe know what it’s like to hold on to a hope that cannot hold up. But this was not that. This was an unbreakable, undeniable, unsinkable hope.\nYes, the two on the Emmaus Road had all but given up that a redeemer was coming. But then they saw Jesus breaking bread in front of their eyes. Yes, the disciples gathered, grieving the death of the one to whom they’d given their lives. But they would soon touch the scarred hands of the Savior. Yes, the friends of Jesus walked weeping to the tomb that morning. But they walked away rejoicing. \n“Why are you looking for the living among the dead?” asked the light-clad angels at the empty tomb. “He is not here, but he has risen!” (vv. 5-6). Their teacher, their prophet, their friend—their hope—was no longer dead in the grave. \nWhen the risen Jesus dined with the Eleven that evening, He said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you—that everything written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled” (v. 44). Everything—all the promises and prophecies of God—are fulfilled in Jesus. \nThe stories are all true. Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior, who lived a life perfectly obedient and pleasing to the Father, bore the punishment of death for our sins, was buried, and rose on the third day, conquering death forever and reconciling us to God the Father. \nFor every hope that comes up empty, for every grave that remains closed, there is the faithful refrain of a loving, living Savior who calls to us: Repent and receive forgiveness (Acts 2:38). Believe and have life (John 3:16-17). Come to me, and I will give you rest (Matthew 11:28). \nJesus Christ is risen! He is risen indeed. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY She Reads Truth\n\nText: Acts 8:26-40, 2 Peter 1:16-21\nIt is impossible to overstate our need for a Savior.\nDuring Lent, Christians traditionally meditate on Scriptures that point us to the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. When we see our desperate need for salvation through the lens of a cross and an empty tomb, we are reminded that nothing we cling to for security outside of Christ Himself can offer us any real or lasting hope.\nIsaiah’s original audience, in the 8th century BC, was made up of people in the process of losing their homeland. They wondered what God’s solution would be, and if He even had one. Isaiah was written during a season of cultural and political unrest in Judah. Their good and steady king, Uzziah, died just as the opposing armies of Assyria chose Judah as their next nation to conquer. As the people of Judah waited and worried, Assyria subdued them and carried them off into exile. \nWhatever hope God’s people had put in their homeland was gone. All they had left to appeal to was the God of their fathers. All they could hope for was that God would intervene and save them. Lent reminds us that this salvation is all any of us can hope for, even as this season declares that Hope has come.\nOne of the most profound and beautiful qualities of Isaiah is how filled it is with references to the coming Savior of the world. Isaiah, more than any other book in the Old Testament, describes the coming of Christ in great detail. This prophet tells us about the One born of a virgin, on whom the Lord would lay the iniquity of us all. This Suffering Servant would be our Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace, and by His wounds we shall be healed. He has called us by name; we are His (Isaiah 43:1). \nDuring this Lent study, we will make our way through the message of restoration in the book of Isaiah. During the final week, we will also read Scripture passages from the Gospels that correspond with the events of Holy Week. Through Isaiah we will look ahead to the Savior, and through the Gospels we will look back on the salvation that is given to us in Jesus.\nMay your time in Isaiah cause you to worship the risen Christ.\n\n",

It’s a somber declaration. In fact, some instead say, “Remember that you have to die.”\nFor more than a thousand years, Christians around the world have begun the Lenten season this way: with the sober acknowledgement that with humanity came sin, and with sin came death. We are free, but not required, to do the same.\nSo what is Ash Wednesday, and why do many Christians observe it? \nAsh Wednesday is a day of repentance. During Lent, we focus on our need for the death and resurrection of Jesus; we focus on our need to be forgiven. Ash Wednesday is a day where we take a page from the book of Job and repent in dust and ashes (Job 42:6). We remember that from the dust we were made and to the dust we shall return (Genesis 3:19). We remember that we have all sinned and fallen short of God’s glory, and yes, we all must die (Romans 3:23). \nAsh Wednesday is a day of hope. Without Christ, the words “remember that you have to die” are hard ones. But with Christ, they are a reminder that, though our bodies will one day return to dust, we have already been given the hope of the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:22).\nAsh Wednesday is an opportunity to publicly profess our faith. The ashen cross the congregant wears is an outward sign of both repentance and hope. People see the mark of the cross at their work, in class, and at the grocery store. Wearing the ashes is a way to repent of our rebellion against God and “confess our sins one to another” (James 5:16).\nOn Ash Wednesday we admit our limits and acknowledge the brevity of this life. Whether in a formal Ash Wednesday service or privately in our homes, we can use tomorrow, the first day of the Lenten season, to remember that from the dust we were made and to the dust we shall return. Even so, in Christ, we live in the eternal hope of the resurrection.\n\n ",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nText: Isaiah 1:1-31, Isaiah 2:1-22, Psalm 68:16-18, Luke 24:44-49\nLent is shocking. \nLent reminds us that sin is real, and so is our need for cleansing. \nThe first two chapters of Isaiah are just as startling. They detail for us the often unwelcome truth of how God views sin and those who nurture sin. \nThe book of Isaiah is the word from God to the people of Israel through His prophet Isaiah around the 8th century B.C. The nation of Israel had developed a comfortable system with God that was becoming overtly transactional instead of relational. As long as we have goats on hand to sacrifice, we’ve got currency to trade with God for sins. It was like kids with spending money, only their goats were no longer good where they were shopping.\n“‘What are all your sacrifices to Me?’ asks the Lord. ‘I have had enough of burnt offerings and rams and the fat of well-fed cattle; I have no desire for the blood of bulls, lambs, or male goats… Stop bringing useless offerings’” (Isaiah 1:11-13).\nIt’s shocking to hear the Lord of Hosts, who prescribed this stop-gap propitiation for sins in the first place, tell His people they’re missing the point at the cost of something so much greater than plump, blemish-free livestock. It’s startling because we prefer to think of God as endlessly patient, a giver of wide margins and benefits of the doubt. But this is not the picture painted in Isaiah 1:15: “When you lift up your hands in prayer, I will refuse to look at you; even if you offer countless prayers, I will not listen.” \nI seriously challenge you to find that verse hand-lettered and framed in any home in your neighborhood. \nIsaiah can be a tough book to read. So when I read passages like these today, I have a lot of questions, and I imagine you do too.\nHow does Old Testament prophecy work?\nAre these just God’s words to Israel then, or are they also judgment on me now?\nHow should we read Old Testament prophecy nearly 3000 years after it was written?\nAnd how can I keep this up for the next 46 days and 66 chapters?\nI may not have perfect answers to all these questions, but here is what I know: the God of Israel who spoke through Isaiah then is the exact same God today. His character is unchanged. His tolerance for sin has not softened around the edges. And while His only begotten Son has since laid down His life as the ultimate, blemish-free sacrifice for our sins, it does nothing to diminish the directive in this three-word sentence: “Stop doing evil” (1:16).\nStop doing evil. \nDon’t take a break from evil. Or fast from evil. Or be sure to clean up after yourself when you’re done. \nStop doing evil. \nWe read Old Testament prophecy to understand God’s character. We read His warnings to the people He loved who did not love Him back, and we heed those warnings. We come to understand what is important to God and make it important to us. We reject the myth of transactional faith, and enter into relationship with the Lord of Hosts. And when we repent, by the grace of God, we turn our backs on our sin completely. We don’t sin because we can, or because we expect God to relent at the sight of our “I’m sorry” bouquet. We stop doing evil. And we keep reading so that we can keep knowing Him more. \nLent is shocking. But it might be just the shock we need.\n \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Isaiah 3:1-26, Isaiah 4:1-6, Exodus 13:21-22, Hebrews 10:10-14\n“There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, ‘Thy will be done,’ and those to whom God says, in the end, ‘Thy will be done.’”\nC.S. Lewis wrote these words in his book The Great Divorce, but they are a fitting description of the scene depicted in Isaiah 3. In this chapter, Judah faces the consequences of their sin, and the consequences are surprising. God does not smite Judah with fire and brimstone. Nor does He send enemies to invade. Instead, God simply gives Judah over to themselves. He allows Judah’s worst impulses to enjoy free reign, most noticeably among their leaders.\nIn his commentary on Isaiah, the late biblical scholar J. Alec Motyer summarized the chapter this way: “Divine judgment on society begins to manifest itself in the disappearance of solid leadership, and the appearance of immature, capricious leaders” (59), all of which result in division, distrust, and widespread societal collapse. In short, Judah gets the leaders they deserve.\nWhat is additionally clear from the passage, is that these leaders rise up from among Judah’s ranks. In other words, the punishment is not wrought from outside, but from within. It is, in a sense, a self-inflicted wound, and this is where we can find ourselves in this story.\nNow, over 2,500 years later, followers of Christ no longer fear punishment because Jesus received it for us. The cross was enough and no further penalty is necessary. However, Isaiah chapters 3 and 4 contain a pattern which still holds true today: God does not wrestle His people into submission. If we insist on disobedience, He allows us to disobey. And when this happens, we experience the consequences of our decision.\nThankfully, the pattern does not stop there. On the heels of Judah’s downfall, the story suddenly shifts, and we encounter an all new tone: \n“In that day the Branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel.”\n– Isaiah 4:2\nWhat are we to make of this abrupt vision of hope?\nThe arc of chapters 3 and 4—from destruction to restoration—reminds us of two truths. The first is that redemption always has the last word. No matter the darkness and confusion, chaos never reigns. God reigns. He is always in control, leading the sadness and the mess toward one inevitable conclusion: He wins. Death dies. Suffering is extinguished. Joy comes in the morning. Whether our leaders are corrupt, or our personal lives are in shambles, this present darkness is not the end of our story.\nThe second truth we see in this passage is that destruction can be a mercy. Sometimes destruction is purely the result of living in a broken world, but sometimes God is doing something more. Sometimes He is destroying something toxic, in order to rebuild it. And sometimes, He permits us to experience the destructiveness of our own choices so that we depart from them. God grants us “our will be done” so that we learn the anguish and emptiness of our own will, and repent and run to His.\nPain or brokenness or even societal strife can be a severe mercy. This strange yet good brokenness is an opportunity to learn and repent and cling to God like never before. God beckons us to turn back from the path of destruction and choose the path that leads to life, and the good news is, it is never, ever too late.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, and mom of two boys.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Isaiah 5:1-30, Isaiah 6:1-13, Psalm 80:17-19, Matthew 21:33-44\nI’ve long been a fan of liturgy. My United Methodist upbringing only offered it in moderate doses and my current church home even less, but I still feel at home in the rhythms, radical though many of them are.\nTake corporate confession, for example. You’d be hard-pressed to find something more unexpected than a group of men, women, and children, many of them strangers or mere acquaintances, joining together to voice aloud their sins and shortcomings. It’s shocking when you consider it, especially in a culture where we work carefully to craft a public image of ourselves that rarely matches the private one.\nCorporate confession is a sort of double humility: we humble ourselves as sinful individuals before God, and we humble ourselves alongside our brothers and sisters as a sinful body of believers. We are saying to God, We are broken; You are whole. We are flawed; You are flawless. We are sinners; You are holy.\nOur condition (sin) is directly opposed to God’s character (purity, holiness).  \nIn Isaiah chapters 5 and 6, the prophet contrasts this “otherness” of God’s glory and holiness with the utter darkness of Judah’s rebellion. The people’s sin has so dramatically distorted their reality that good and bad are reversed in their eyes. God’s messenger Isaiah declares, “Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness” (5:20).\nBut God—“His glory fills the whole earth” (6:3), and Isaiah is humbled at the sight of Him. Heavenly beings hover around the Lord, calling out, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts,” as the temple shakes and fills with smoke (6:4).\nWhat does Isaiah do at the astonishing sight of God’s holiness? He voices a confession:\nWoe is me for I am ruined\nbecause I am a man of unclean lips\nand live among a people of unclean lips,\nand because my eyes have seen the King,\nthe Lord of Hosts.\n– Isaiah 6:5\nNotice that Isaiah’s confession is personal (“I am a man of unclean lips”) and corporate (“I live among a people of unclean lips”). Isaiah is aware of his own rebellion against God, as well as his place among a rebellious people. Repentance involves both confessing to God our sinful actions and our sinful condition.\nIt’s like the parable of the vineyard owner in Matthew 21. God is the vineyard owner, and what more could He have given us? Yet we corrupted His good gift. He sent His Son, and we were the ones who put Him to death—not because we were present at the crucifixion, but because ours was the sin that sentenced Him to die. All of us. We are all sinners and we are all sinful.\nLeft to ourselves, we would have no hope. Thanks be to God, we have not been left to ourselves. As we confess our sins and our sinful condition before our holy God, we also give thanks for Jesus, who took our sin upon Himself. In Jesus, the radically unholy are clothed in righteousness and reconciled to God.\nBecause of Jesus, we are ushered into the presence of the One whose holiness fills the whole earth—the One who is three times holy. Holy is God the Father. Holy is Christ the Son. Holy is His Spirit, mercifully poured out on those who confess their sins and believe on Christ. Holy, holy, holy.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText:  Isaiah 7:1-25, Isaiah 8:1-22, Hebrews 9:24, 1 Peter 1:14-16\nI’ll be the first to admit that when I read a book like Isaiah, I immediately want to understand all the history. As a former world history teacher, I really should already have this stuff down pat, but I don’t. So I dug back into my old lesson plans to see what I could rediscover about Assyria. \nHistorians suspect that the world’s first organized society developed in the “cradle of civilization” between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers (modern-day Iraq and Syria). It was fertile land, easy to farm, and smack-dab in the middle of the biggest landmass in the world. If you wanted to be a farmer, a businessman, or a conqueror, you couldn’t find a better jumping-off point. That’s why over the centuries, so many different empires fought to claim that land. None were as strong or ambitious as the Assyrians; their empire was the first to make militarism the central policy of state.\nAround the time of Isaiah, Assyrians were on the warpath. They’d already amassed a great amount of land to the north and east, and had their sights on Egypt. God’s people were literally right in the way. In addition to that, the kingdom of Israel had fractured into two pieces: Judah in the south and Israel in the north. At just the time when God’s people needed to be strong and unified against a foreign threat, they were deeply divided. At the beginning of Isaiah chapter 7, we’re told that the king of Judah and all of his people were afraid for their lives. They had two enemies to contend with, Assyria and Israel. In many ways, they felt surrounded, defenseless. \nAnd yet, they were not alone. In the midst of these harrowing geopolitical circumstances, Isaiah told the people of Judah, “Be careful, keep calm and don’t be afraid” (Isaiah 7:4). Isaiah also makes a strange promise: the people would receive a sign that God was still good. A virgin would give birth to a child and His name would be Immanuel—God with us (v.14).\nThe rest of the prophecy was hardly pretty poetry. Judah saw Assyria as an enemy, and as Isaiah explained, God planned to use that enemy to accomplish His purposes. Egyptians were like flies, Assyrians were like bees—and they were coming to infest the land. Assyria would be a like a razor that arrived to cut off all of God’s people’s hair, leaving them in humiliation (v.20). With that as their future, how could the people of God be careful, keep calm, and remain unafraid? How was God with them? \nGod is with us, even in calamity. Our fear is not proof that our God is absent. \nSo often I want an Isaiah in my life. I want someone to come and tell me specifically what’s going to happen this year, next year, and the year after that. I want details. Dates. Times. I want a sign. In reading today’s passages, I realize that even if I got what I wanted—even if someone like Isaiah really did come to tell me what was to come—it might only lead to more confusion. It would likely only lead to fear of my circumstances, rather than fear of my Lord.\nPerhaps all I really need to hear are the promises. Perhaps all I need to do is wait.\nYou are to regard only the Lord of Hosts as holy.\nOnly He should be feared;\nOnly He should be held in awe.\nHe will be your sanctuary.\n– Isaiah 8:13-14\n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Isaiah 9:1-21, Isaiah 10:1-4, Psalm 2:1-12,  John 3:19-21\nGordon, Andrew, and Dennis were some real troublemakers back in the day. \nWe only had a few hours’ warning to prepare for their arrival, and as soon as they approached, everyone knew to hide. They’d charge through town leaving destruction in their wake, then exit, never to be seen again. We were never the same after their visits. Growing up in Florida, we’d curse Gordon, Andrew, and Dennis—the hurricanes of my childhood—for years to come.\nI remember Andrew the most. He arrived just before bedtime, without a hint of common houseguest courtesy. The winds howled, the trees fell, the lights flickered then remained off, as did the power. A constant cracking noise in the backyard accompanied thunderclaps and lightning bolts in the sky. Enveloped in darkness, we tried to drown out the noise—and our fear—with layers of blankets and pillows. We’d drift off for a few minutes, hoping to sleep through the night, only to be awakened by the next big BOOM!\nWe didn’t know if the noises we heard were in the backyard or down the road. We weren’t sure which way the storm was moving, if it was dying down, or just getting started. We didn’t know if the power would come back on in the morning, or if we’d be without lights for the week. We couldn’t see the damage for the darkness.\nSound familiar? Isaiah left us with a similar prophecy of darkness:\n“They will look toward the earth and see only distress, darkness, and the gloom of affliction, and they will be driven into thick darkness.”\n– Isaiah 8:22\nCan we sit here for a moment? We may feel ready to skip to the next paragraph because we know what happens next, but friends, we can’t. We shouldn’t. It is only because of Jesus that we are even aware that darkness has an opposite. Let’s gather ‘round with the people of Jerusalem, desperate for morning, aching for light. Hoping it will come again soon.\n“Nevertheless…\nThe people walking in darkness\nhave seen a great light;\na light has dawned\non those living in the land of darkness.”\n– Isaiah 9:1-2\nNevertheless.\nWe may not be able to assess the damage through the darkness, but we can approach the darkness knowing it has been defeated, knowing that light has already had the last say.\nMatthew Henry said, “It is comforting to us that when things are at the darkest, that He who forms the light and creates the darkness has appointed to both their bounds and set the one over against the other.”\nThe Lord didn’t just put darkness and light in place; He bridged the gap between them. He sent our Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace to reach through thick darkness and bring us into the light (Isaiah 9:6).\nWe may not know what the morning will bring, but we already know what Jesus’ work on the cross has brought. By His grace, may we remember that His light is more than enough.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nText: Isaiah 10:5-34, Isaiah 11:1-16, Isaiah 12:1-6, Romans 8:19-22\nIt is a barren landscape we stumble upon in Isaiah 11. \nIn the previous chapter, God has struck down every kingdom that comes against Judah, using the imagery of an axe taken to all the trees in the forest. It is stumps and dryness as far as the eye can see, with the exception of one small sign of life: \n“Then a shoot will grow from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots will bear fruit.”\n– Isaiah 11:1\nJesus, born of the bloodline of Jesse, David’s father, is the only surviving hope in an otherwise hopeless world. He is a shoot, or branch, that will come back, bear fruit, and establish a kingdom of peace. \nWere I an Israelite in the southern kingdom of Judah, oh, how I would have clung to those words. And, oh, how I want to cling to them today as I look around at the forest I’ve grown. \nThe trees in my forest are shaped like idols and they grow to stifle the work Christ is doing in me. I water these trees and trim their branches, in search of the life they promise to give. But every time—every single time—I find they bring emptiness instead. I know what it’s like to grow a forest, and I know what it’s like to see every tree cut down, for my idols to be stripped away, one by one by the gracious hand of my Father. When the painful work is done, I look up and see the true Source of the garden, the only remnant of life.\nWhen the things of our lives are torn down, a visual path is cleared that reveals Jesus in a way we couldn’t see Him before the trees fell. This stripping gives us the strength to cling to the True Vine. \nJesus said it Himself. “I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in Me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without Me” (John 15:5). \nSometimes everything must be torn down in order for us to see that Christ truly is at the center of it all, the reason for everything, the source of our life and all life. Even in a seemingly barren land, He rises up. The root and the branch, the Alpha and the Omega. He was never absent. He has always been here. Through every story and circumstance, a vine running throughout all of history. Christ is in every last inch.\nOne day this will all be so evident. We will gather together under one banner and the entire world will know. “The nations will look to him for guidance, and his resting place will be glorious” (Isaiah 11:10). Until then, we wait, knowing that no matter how bleak or despairing the landscape appears, the One True Vine grows still.\n \n",

It’s about a man whose wife had died in a tragic accident. In his anguish he agreed to donate her heart to someone else who needed it. Time goes by, and as fate would have it, he meets and (of course) falls in love with the woman who happened to receive his wife’s heart—returning to the one it was made to love. Cue the tears and pass the popcorn because this movie made me a blubbering mess.\nStories like this one captivate me—many of us, really—because our hearts long for an epic love story of our own. As it turns out, one has already been written. We only need to turn to the pages of God’s Word to hear the cadence of His own heart beating like a drum for His people, just as it always has. To Israel He said:\nFor the Lord will have compassion on Jacob and will again choose Israel, and will set them in their own land, and sojourners will join them and will attach themselves to the house of Jacob.\n– Isaiah 14:1\nThroughout the book of Isaiah we hear God stating His love and compassion toward His people, saying, in essence—\nI, Jehovah, have a heart bent with mercy toward you.\nI, Jehovah, will choose you again and again.\nI, Jehovah, will bring you back to a land of promise.\nReturn.\nReturn.\nReturn.\nGod has written a story with a plan and a purpose to draw His children back to Himself. Can anyone rewrite the story? Will prideful, land-hungry kings or the captivity of the people of promise change the merciful beat of His heart? No, never. For He has made this provision for them: “The Lord has founded Zion, and His afflicted people find refuge in her” (Isaiah 14:32).\nBut what was Zion to them? \nThe Lord made it holy by His habitation, His presence there among them. And so they called it the “City of God.” Though weak compared to invading armies, Zion was a place for the needy and afflicted to flee for protection because God was there. He was the place where they could find hope, their only true refuge and strength. He was their Promised Land. \nWe have much in common with Israel, those whom God chose and loved and longed to offer refuge in His presence. They were runners and rule breakers, sinners and cynics. So are we. Yet His heart beats for us, even now. It beckons to us.\nWe must return to Him—to the God who, by His compassion and grace, has given His people refuge for generations on end. We must return to the gospel of His Son, Jesus Christ, time and time again—to remember it and rehearse it our hearts. Only then will our hearts find rest from the invasions and distractions of this world. \nMay we return with great joy to the One our hearts were made for, and then keep coming back, day after day. For He is our One true God for ever and ever, even to the end. He will always lead us back to Him (Psalm 48:14).\n\nStacey Thacker is a wife and the mother of four girls.

While swapping “war stories” of adoption heartbreak over coffee, she told me she sometimes finds herself wishing she had HIV, too. I assumed she meant she’d be more than willing to suffer with the virus if that meant her baby wouldn’t have to—kind of a quid pro quo penitential parenting kind of thing. Or maybe she was just being overly emotional and hyperbolic, as mamas often are when it comes to our children.\nSeveral years later, I stood sobbing in the customs line at Miami International Airport, overwhelmed by the glorious reality that Missy was finally (officially!) my daughter. It had been two long, roller-coaster years of slogging through seemingly endless paperwork in the maddeningly slow Haitian welfare system. For twenty-four months, I’d worried about her physical and emotional health from two thousand miles away. \nJust a few days after bringing her home, we found ourselves at Vanderbilt Children’s Hospital. I held Missy in my arms as she screamed in terror, contorting her tiny body throughout the first of what will likely be a lifetime of blood draws. That’s when I really understood what my friend meant. \nI sat on the edge of the pleather chair in the phlebotomist’s office, rocking my precious, panicky daughter, whispering in her ear, “It’s going to be okay, baby. This is going to sting for a second, but it’ll be over quickly. I’m so sorry, honey. Mwen se konsa regrèt.” But I wasn’t able to quiet her terrified shrieks or calm her violent twisting because she’d been traumatized by some barbaric medical procedures as a toddler being treated in Port Au Prince. And though she called me her Mama Blan (white mama), she didn’t completely trust me yet.\nThat’s when I thought, Now, I get it. Now I understand what my friend meant when she said she wished she had HIV like her child. Because in these moments I’d do just about anything to be able to connect with Missy on every level, to comfort her from a place of true empathy. \nI’d gladly suffer anything to ensure my little girl would never feel alone, no matter what the situation.\nMissy may have been conceived in my heart instead of my womb, but let me tell you something: Every. Single. Thing. that concerns her concerns me. I am wildly passionate about her welfare. And God the Father is infinitely more concerned about His children—even the rebellious ones who rebuff His mercy like the Moabites did. Because while the chapters we’ve been reading in Isaiah clearly depict God’s coming judgment of the wicked, they also clearly depict His mourning over their unrepentant future:\nMy heart cries out over Moab.\n– Isaiah 15:5\nIn his profound commentary on Isaiah, Alec Motyer writes that God “weeps as he smites.” Our Creator Redeemer is not one of those dads who disciplines first and thinks later. He is a perfect parent, and His harshest correction and discipline are always, always braided with compassion.\nThis makes me feel especially safe and secure as His child, but it also challenges me to sow increasingly more love and kindness into the biblical truisms I seek to show and tell. By the grace of God, may we all be the type of people who weep rather than celebrate when our Heavenly Father disciplines another image-bearer. May our soft sides be far more frayed with use than our hard sides. And may we not have to wait for our self-made altars to crumble before we look to our loving, compassionate, merciful Maker (Isaiah 17:7).\n\nLisa Harper is a master storyteller with a masters of Theological Studies from Covenant Seminary.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Isaiah 18:1-7, Isaiah 19:1-25, Isaiah 20:1-6, Matthew 10:16-23, Romans 9:14-18\nWhen my kids were younger, they would sometimes hide. I’m not talking about hiding in the peek-a-boo or hide-n-seek sense—though those were games we all loved to play together. No, they hid because they didn’t want to be found. If you’ve been around kids at all, you know exactly what I’m talking about. Kids often try to hide, however poorly, what they don’t want others to see.\nI’ve been tempted to do the same in the face of being found out, when the Lord reveals my sin to me. But as today’s readings remind me, God is a righteous judge who will not be mocked. One day, we will all give account for what we’ve done (Romans 14:12), but it won’t be a time to impart information to the Lord—He already knows all things (Psalm 139). Rather than send us into hiding, these truths should lead us to confession, repentance, and ultimately worship. \nThe good news for you and me—for all who believe—is that though God is just, He is also merciful. He knows judgment is coming, and so it’s His kindness that leads us to repentance (Romans 2:4). In His extravagant mercy, He seeks us out to make Himself known, even if we refuse to acknowledge Him (Romans 1:20). But when we do turn to Him and pray to receive His mercy, we recognize, as Paul did, that our righteousness is completely in the hands of the Lord:\nWhat shall we say then? Is there injustice on God’s part? By no means! For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”\n– Romans 9:14-15\nRedemption depends not on our human will or exertion, but on our kind and merciful God. In His redeeming us He displays His power in us, so that His name might be proclaimed in all the earth, to those who have yet to turn to Him (Romans 9:17).\nThe Lord is active and present, working in so many ways and in so many places (John 5:17). But we can easily miss Him. We can drown Him out with distractions and busyness. We can tune Him out like Adam and Eve did, then run and hide from Him in our sin, instead of running into His arms for forgiveness. Even so, He pursues us—working both broadly in the world and intimately in our hearts—to bring us back to where we belong: in His presence. Though we were once far off and lost, the blood of Jesus has brought us close (Ephesians 2:13). \nWe were made to be found. So look for Him. Listen. Pay attention. Count the ways you see the Lord’s hand at work. Draw near to Him. Seek Him with all your heart, and rest assured, He will be found by you (Jeremiah 29:12-14). \nThis is the Lord’s mercy to you and me—not by our might, but by His.\n\nTrillia Newbell is the author of Enjoy: Finding the Freedom to Delight Daily in God’s Good Gifts, Fear and Faith: Finding the Peace Your Heart Craves (2015) and United: Captured by God’s Vision for Diversity (2014). Trillia is married to her best friend, Thern, they reside with their two children near Nashville, TN.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Isaiah 21:1-17, Isaiah 22:1-25, 1 Corinthians 15:54, 1 Peter 2:6\nWe’re in the thick of Isaiah’s prophecy now, about a third of the way through the book we call by his name. But if you’re like me, things don’t feel much clearer than when we first began. So far in our reading, I’ve come across more questions than answers. But I think that’s okay. I think this feeling we’re feeling (are you feeling it, too?) is by design. We are not meant to feel comfortable here.\nIsaiah’s prophecy to this point, both in general and in detail, is dark. If his message were one of those Magic 8-balls we had when we were kids, we’d shake it and it would say, “Outlook not good.” Judgment was coming. This was certain.\n“Looking” is a recurring theme in these two chapters. We see it in chapter 21 when the Lord tells Isaiah, “Go, post a lookout; let him report what he sees” (v.6). The watchman sees what the Lord said he would: horsemen approaching in pairs. “Babylon has fallen, has fallen,” the Lord replies. “All the images of her gods have been shattered on the ground” (v.9).\nAs readers of Isaiah’s prophecy, we look, too, watching the scene through our modern-day imaginations. And we see it: destruction and devastation, pain and anguish. We see a kingdom fall along with its false gods—gods incapable of rescue.\nFurther into chapter 21, we see the lookers again. In his oracle against Dumah, Isaiah reports: “One calls to me from Seir, ‘Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?” (v.11). Desperation echoes in the repetition; surely there is something good, somewhere off in the distance? And there is—for a moment. “Morning has come, and also night,” the watchman replies (v.12). There is hope, sure, he says, but it won’t last.\nIn short, Isaiah 21 leaves us right where we started: lost in darkness and despair, no hope to be found among us.\nNo hope to be found among us. \nHope had to come to us. And Hope did, though we refused to see Him (John 1:10-11).\nIn chapter 22, Isaiah’s prophecy pivots to an oracle against Jerusalem, the holy city itself. Though referred to here as the “Valley of Vision,” Jerusalem was blind. They’d built up walls of self-reliance and weapons of their own strength, all in vain. They looked to themselves, forgetting their God. The prophet says to them:\n“You made a reservoir between the walls for the waters of the ancient pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or consider the One who created it long ago.”\n– Isaiah 22:11\nGod called Israel to repent, but they had a party. God offered them solace, but they celebrated their futility instead. God said “Look!”, but they would not see.\nWhat about us? Will we look? Not just to the future, hoping for a bright light on the horizon. Not to ourselves, drawing strength from our empty wells. And certainly not to whatever shallow joy we can cook up on our own. No, we look to the Lord of Hosts.\nThe Lord is the One who establishes kings and kingdoms, and He is the One who remains after they fall. \nThe Lord is the One who calls out to those in darkness and implores them to see His face—beautiful, holy, good. \nThe Lord is the One whose holy justice cannot overlook sin, and He is the One whose merciful compassion provides sin’s remedy at His own expense.\nThe cross of Christ was the darkest point on the landscape of humanity, but that sacrifice purchased our rescue. Because of Jesus, His death and glorious resurrection, death itself “has been swallowed up in victory” (1 Corinthians 15:54).\nDevastation is still all around us, and we are bowed down, dismayed (Isaiah 21:3). But we look. We look to Christ. We look to Christ and we return to Him, repenting of our sin and trusting Jesus, the only true and lasting Hope. \nThanks be to God and to Jesus Christ, our eternal, incorruptible Savior. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Annie Downs\n\nText: Isaiah 23:1-18, Isaiah 24:1-23, Romans 1:18-23, Philippians 2:5-11\n\nOn a sunny day in January, I stood at the very end of a jetty on Newport Beach. (I don’t live in California, but I’ll take a work trip to the left coast in the middle of winter every year, please and thank you.) I hadn’t originally wanted to walk all the way to the end of the jetty, out where the water gets deep and the waves crash. There were so many jagged-edged rocks, and I know my own proclivity toward injury. I also have a thing with sharks (that thing being a massive fear of sharks), so the whole experience seemed less than enjoyable.\nBut I wanted to see the view from there. It felt like it might mean something to me. So I cautiously walked out. It was probably only thirty yards long, but it took me a few minutes to maneuver my way down the rocks. The view was beautiful, and I was right: it was worth the trek. I stood there—Ellie Holcomb’s latest album, Red Sea Road, in my ears—watching the ocean, while somehow standing right in the middle of it. I was so glad I’d made the effort.\n That is, until the waves started to crash, each one a little wilder than the last. As I watched them roll in and out with increasing force, I became nervous, pushing my hands out in front of me like a crossing guard and saying out loud, “Okay, waves, be cool. Settle down.” \nAnd then I heard a tiny giggle behind me.\nUnbeknownst to me, a family had walked out to the end of the jetty as well. The son, no older than seven, was standing right behind me. “You can’t boss the ocean like that,” he said to me, laughing. And I laughed, too, though admittedly a little embarrassed.\nBut he was right: I can’t control the waves. I know I can’t. (But it felt good to try.) And yet, when life presents those walk-to-the-edge-of-the-jetty opportunities, I’m game. I get “brave,” then act as if I can control what happens next. As soon as something gets uncomfortable—like those waves crashing a little too high for my liking—I want to take control. \nIt seems like this is all God wants to talk with me about these days: control, and my lack of it. And my continual persistence in trying to prove to Him that I’ve got everything under control, thankyouverymuch. \nBut I don’t. So I constantly find myself returning to Him, confessing those moments when I grasp for the reins, then gently allowing His Word, His voice, to remind me that me being out of control isn’t all that bad. Because in reality, He’s been in control all along.\n Admitting my lack of control is just an admission of what’s true: God controls all the things. Nothing is out of His grasp or view. Not oceans or governments, the weather or my heart. I’m never really flailing or falling—I’m held, kept. No matter how chaotic life feels, the waves will not overtake me. The One whose hand stretched out over the ocean waters—the One who created them—can surely calm them (Isaiah 23:11; 48:13). Nothing moves without His knowledge. \nI can’t stand before the sea and tell the waves which way to roll. But He can. The same power that raised Christ from the dead is at work in my life (Romans 8:11). I can’t heal my own heart, save the lost, right the wrongs, or calm the storm—in me, in my home, or in the world. But He can. And He does. Because He holds all things together.\n \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Isaiah 25:1-12, Genesis 3:17-19, Hebrews 12:22-24\nWhen I was a teenager our house was hit by a tornado. Seeing trees leveled, cars smashed, and our back porch splintered into a million fragments—it was disarming. \nReading through the middle section of Isaiah makes me feel a bit like I did as I surveyed the post-tornado damage. Chapter after chapter, Isaiah prophesied about God’s impending judgment. It was bad news all around. From Babylon to Arabia, Jerusalem to Egypt, then ultimately the whole earth, Isaiah foretells a reckoning so widespread that the entire planet will be “stripped completely bare” (Isaiah 24:3). He describes a time when all celebration will cease (v.8) and how “panic, pit, and trap” await all who dwell on the earth (v.17). \nMy response to these chapters is to cover my eyes and read them through slightly opened fingers. But that is not how Isaiah reacts. \nAs chapter 24 wraps, God stops speaking to Isaiah about what’s coming. Isaiah doesn’t grit his teeth or pout or whimper. Faced with the news of the world’s coming woes, Isaiah erupts in praise:\n“The Lord, You are my God; I will exalt You. I will praise Your name, for you have accomplished wonders, plans formed long ago, with perfect faithfulness.”\n– Isaiah 25:1\nBecause he knows the complete character of God, Isaiah can look past the devastation and see God’s power. He can look beyond the judgment and see God’s faithfulness. \nWhile Isaiah had a front row seat to some very bad news, he was also among the very first to know the good news of the gospel. \nHe foretold the Messiah, born to a virgin and given the name Immanuel (Isaiah 7:14).\nHe knew our Savior would come from the line of David (Isaiah 9:7).\nHe even foresaw Jesus’ burial in a tomb purchased by Joseph of Arimathea (Isaiah 53:9).\nGod gifted Isaiah eyes to see past his moment in history and into the mystery of the gospel. Long before any other human knew that Jesus would die on a hill, be buried in a borrowed tomb, and leave His burial clothes behind to return in a resurrected body, Isaiah saw a reason to celebrate: “On this mountain He will destroy the burial shroud, the shroud over all the peoples, the sheet covering all the nations” (Isaiah 25:7). \nYes, God was going to put an end to certain wicked rulers and pagan practices. He would wipe out evil and sin, but He would also destroy death and sorrow. Isaiah celebrated because he knew that the shroud, or curtain, that separated all of humanity from God would soon be torn in two. \nJesus, give us eyes to see past the devastation to the good news of the gospel. Amen.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Isaiah 26:1-21, Isaiah 27:1-13, Psalm 74:12-17, Philippians 4:4-7\nI am writing this on Inauguration Day, the culmination of one of the most polarizing election years our country has ever seen. Even before my feet touched the floor this morning, I remembered the tension of our divided country and felt the fragility of my own heart. My mind was caught up in contemplating our limited human condition. I felt my earthiness and all the limitations of being human. Another way of saying this is that I felt temporal, the opposite of everlasting. \nI write today of Isaiah chapter 26, which begins, “We have a strong city, he sets up salvation as walls and bulwarks” (v.1). Yet our country feels weak today, utterly broken. Weak not because of who our president is or was or will someday be, but because the transfer of power from one mere human being to another betrays our weakness in its very act of impermanence. \nWe cannot do any work eternally; we can only do eternal work. That is, our abilities are temporary and limited, but our work can be done for the “strong city” Isaiah speaks of—the city that is eternal. Today is constantly passing away, and our contributions here are, too. But Isaiah’s words cause me to remember what is true of our eternal God:\nYou will keep the mind that is dependent on you\nin perfect peace,\nfor it is trusting in you.\n– Isaiah 26:3\nIt is easy to look at the terra, the earth, and think our trust is born of blood, sweat, tears, dirt—the rise and fall of ideas and businesses and churches and politics. Each of us inhabits a kingdom, whether it be our home, our job, our family, or our community, and we are tempted to believe in its permanence. But we must be careful to remember that the King of our hearts is not our pastor, our president, our husband, our friend, or even ourselves. \nThe King of our hearts is made not from dust; He is not coming to ashes at the end. The King of our hearts is forever and ever and ever, without end. \nIsaiah continues, “Trust in the Lord forever for the Lord God is an everlasting rock” (Isaiah 26:4). God, who made everything and will make it over again, will lose not a bit of Himself in the process. \nThe day is Yours, also the night;\nYou established the moon and the sun.\nYou set all the boundaries of the earth;\nYou made summer and winter.\n– Psalm 74:16-17\nThere are moments of pure elation and joy when we forget what earthlings we are, made from dust to dust, ashes to ashes—we feel invincible. And then, in another moment, this world is just too much with us and we with it. The Lenten season reminds us of our fragility, our humanity, our humility, our humus, the Latin word for “earth.” From dust we have come and to dust we will return. \nBut Jesus is an everlasting rock. The King of our hearts, of this world and of the world to come, is our never-ending, all-knowing, all-seeing, and eternal God. The Kingdom belongs to Him alone, as does the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nText: Isaiah 28:1-29, Isaiah 29:1-24, Revelation 5:1-14\n“We’re not worthy! We’re not worthy!” \nYeah, I was a kid in the 90s. Anybody else remember imitating Wayne and Garth to declare your unworthiness over things like Nintendo skills, Lisa Frank sticker collections, or Air Jordans? My assessment of worthiness is different now, but I’m still inclined to assess things by my arbitrary categories of value. I am not immune to questioning my own worthiness in the face of a really lovely turn of phrase or a well-managed garden.\nBut is my worthiness the relevant question? It surely seems to be the contemporary question, one Paul clearly answered for us in Romans, long before we ever started trying to compete for Instagram likes. \n“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”\n– Romans 3:23\nIt’s almost a relief, really; the playing field is leveled and we have all fallen short. And it answers the question of human worthiness: Which of us is worthy? Not a one. \nSo what are the qualifications for worthiness? God’s people were waiting for someone who was worthy. And their list of qualifications was far more than a wink and a well-executed somersault. \nHe was to be both the root and the stem of David (Isaiah 9:7, Luke 1:30-32). He would be born of a virgin (Isaiah 7:14, Luke 1:27-28, 31) and God’s Spirit would rest on Him (Isaiah 11:2, Mark 1:10). He would be both the Lion of the tribe of Judah (Revelation 5:5) and the Lamb who would be slain (Isaiah 53:5, 1 Peter 2:24).\nAll that, and yet the list was still completely simple: He had to be the Son of God (Isaiah 9:6; Psalm 2:6-7). He alone is worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, worthy to bring salvation and bring justice (Revelation 5:1-14). \nBut His worthiness doesn’t end there. He is to receive all the riches of heaven and earth—all material things, all praise, all everything belongs to Him alone. Suddenly the complicated question becomes simple again. \nDutch journalist, statesman, and theologian Abraham Kuyper said, “There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not cry, ‘Mine!’” That about says it all. Christ is worthy, and all honor is due to Him. \nThis simplifies my plaguing difficulties in wondering where I sit in the pecking order. It eliminates the question of “who deserves this more?” And frankly, it resolves my need to be celebrated by the world. When I turn my eyes from myself and point my compass to the True North, Christ Himself, I cease scrambling for a place at the table because I find myself at rest, pointing to the One who is truly worthy.\nBecause of Christ, we can join with the angels and the archangels and the whole company of heaven and sing a new song:\nYou are worthy to take the scroll\nand to open its seals,\nbecause You were slaughtered,\nand You redeemed people\nfor God by Your blood\nfrom every tribe and language\nand people and nation.\nYou made them a kingdom\nand priests to our God,\nand they will reign on the earth.\n—Revelation 5:9-10\n\n",

Deer, antelope, and even mountain lions have been known to scurry onto the road at the most inconvenient times. You know that terrifying moment when you lock eyes with the poor creature over your steering wheel and just pray they will move? If only the animal would keep moving forward—then they’d be safe. But it seems that nine times out of ten, they have the worst instincts and either freeze or run back into traffic.\nSometime we have a similar response to danger.\nIt’s easy to become immobilized by fear or anxiety in the midst of a big decision or overwhelming circumstances. The stress of a crisis can send us to running back to old, unhealthy habits and vices. In those moments of panic, I can all too easily forget that my God is bigger than all the worries of this world—that I can trust Him to lead me.\nThe prophet Isaiah rebuked the people of Judah for turning to their own devices of self-saving. In Isaiah’s time, God’s people in Judah were terrified of Assyrian armies amassing on their border. They sensed a very imminent danger. Instead of trusting in God and seeking His power and plan, Judah turned back to Egypt for safety in an alliance. \nLet’s pause here, just for moment… \nThey turned back to the very Egypt that had previously enslaved them? \nThese descendants of Abraham and David had inherited great promises and seen great wonders of the Lord’s blessing and salvation. Yet in crisis they turned to what they could see and remember, rather than seeking God’s merciful path forward.\nWhy is it so easy to look for help everywhere but the feet of Jesus? Perhaps because we are prone to self-focus. Theologians such as St. Augustine of Hippo, Martin Luther, and Karl Barth all described our sin nature as incurvatus in se; Latin for “curved inward on oneself.” Because we are imperfect people, we tend to focus inward instead of outward, if we’re not relying on the Spirit to lead us.\nWhen Judah trembled with fear at a crossroads, the people turned inward and backward instead of upward and forward. They turned inward by serving pagan gods of the culture around them and turned backward toward the familiar power of Egypt. But their faithful God longed for them to turn upward toward His mercy, and forward on the path He made for them.\nWhen we are fearful about the circumstances in our lives, it’s easy to turn toward our generations’ idols of success and security, or backward to old habits of self-reliance like control, apathy, or anxiety. But the Lord longs to bring our focus upward and forward just as He did with Judah. \nIt’s convicting to think of the ways we fall short, but there is good news: we love a God of incomprehensible mercy. He relentlessly called—and calls—His people back to Him. The Holy Spirit guides us in the way to go: the way of Jesus, our Savior. \n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

Well, “training” is a very scary and overly athletic-sounding term for what I’ve actually been doing. The simple truth is, I signed up for a race a while back, and I’m trying my best to not quit.\nIf you check my running history (read: “couch-sitting”), you’ll see that the odds of my completing the race aren’t exactly favorable. Then you’ll understand why you’re the first to hear about this half-marathon business: because I’m afraid to fail. I don’t want my family and friends to be cheering and waiting for me at a finish line I’ll never cross.\nSome mornings, I wake up ready to tie my shoes and pound the pavement. Others, I can barely make the stretch to hit the snooze button. For every one of my consistencies, there are five inconsistencies. When I give attention to one thing, others suffer. \nI’m not sure that I’m a real runner.\nI will try my best to keep my promises.\nI cannot make any guarantees.\nIsaiah prophesies about running. He tells Israel they will run from their country. He tells us we will run from our God.\nWoe to those who go down to Egypt for help\nand who depend on horses!\nThey trust in the abundance of chariots\nand in the large number of horsemen.\nThey do not look to the Holy One of Israel\nand they do not seek the Lord’s help.\n– Isaiah 31:1\nWe think we can run on our own fuel. But when we try to do just that, we end up running away from the only One who can help us. \nThe promises we make to ourselves and others—to be more, to do better, to show up—can only ever be based on future hope. But God’s promises—to love us, to fight for our good, to never leave—are hinged on His current character and constant devotion. We can only hope to be consistent; He is constant. \nLike the Israelites, if we look to our current disasters and future betrayals, we may think God, too, is running from His people. But if we look first to His promises, we see His loving path is already there, laid out before us, ready and waiting.\nIsaiah also says this about our Lord: “But He also is wise and brings disaster. He does not go back on what He says” (Isaiah 31:2). Because love isn’t always giving us what we want; it’s being Who we need. While I can’t guarantee you’ll see me at the finish line in a few months, I know He’ll still be running to me—to all of us—just as He promised. \nPraise the Lord, our only help, for He is faithful.\n\n",

Someone in the city has acted on their perverted sense of justice and gone on a violent rampage. Systemic evil is evident everywhere—in the courts, on the streets, in the schools, at the market. Idolatrous liaisons with demons incite entire people groups and nations to war with each other, stealing resources, asserting their superiority, and annihilating fellow divine-image bearers. Painful truth bursts out of the darkness and into the light, breaking hearts and dissolving trust. Destroyers, traitors, and betrayers swarm like locusts. \nHow much more of this heart-wrenching, stomach-turning news can we take? And this is only the news we are aware of in our limited perspectives. \nOur world today is not unlike Isaiah’s. We are not unlike the sinners against whom the prophet declared God’s judgment. And so we echo Isaiah’s cry for mercy:\nO Lord, be gracious to us; we wait for you.\n– Isaiah 33:2\nOur waiting is not in vain. Centuries pass through the annals of time, but God remembers every moment. Millions upon millions of people have walked this earth, but God knows every hair on every head. God hears the ground cry out—satiated with the blood of people whom He created in His own image. He will rise up and punish His enemies. \nDestroyers, traitors, betrayers, the godless—tremble before the Lord. Hear what He has done, and acknowledge His might. He will fill Zion with justice and righteousness. There will be no escape for those who hate the King of kings. \nBut God offers amnesty to His enemies. His Son came as our Deliverer.\nAs Isaiah promised, the day of vengeance is coming when the King returns as the judge. His judgment is just and pure; He is not partial. Yet He is full of compassion and slow to anger (Exodus 34:6). His faithful love is evident throughout the Old Testament, generation after generation, and displayed in full in the person and sacrifice of Christ.\nOh, that we would look to the cross and behold our King in His beauty today! Take up your role as an ambassador and plead with your friends, your loved ones, and yes, even those who hate you, to gaze upon Jesus, our Deliverer. “Today draw near. Today give attention. Today hear! For our sake He made Him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:21).\nThis news, too, is overwhelming. But it overwhelms me in a different way. I can almost feel my heart leaping for joy out of my chest! I still wonder how this can really be, this gospel news that seems almost too good to be true. But the Good Shepherd says, “Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom” (Luke 12:32). \nBehold the King in His beauty. Tremble before the Lord who is a consuming fire, and worship Him.\n\nGloria Furman is a wife, mother of four, cross-cultural worker, and writer.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Isaiah 35:1-10, Isaiah 36:1-22, Hebrews 12:14, Revelation 21:4\nI lead a women’s Bible study at The Next Door, a faith-based residential addiction recovery program. When visiting, I always bring dark chocolate (which, admittedly, is self-serving), and some small amenity they don’t have easy access to, like good shampoo or soft socks. Just a little treat to remind them someone’s pulling for them while they’re fighting the toughest battle of their lives.\nSo when I went to Ireland a few years ago, I picked up a some small souvenirs for my Next Door friends: some fancy European chocolate, miniature Celtic crosses, and cheesy leprechaun keychains. I also kept a few euros, assuming they might enjoy seeing the difference between European money and American money. \nBut when I got back home I thought twice about bringing them the euros. I wondered if giving them foreign coins might come across as condescending since that’s usually the type of trinket you give a child. Or if it would rub salt in their wounds, since most of them are on parole because of past felonies and are very limited when it comes to traveling within the US, much less internationally. In the end, I decided to leave the coins in my bag and thought, “I’ll just play it by ear when I get there.”  \nOf course my gracious friends were overtly appreciative of everything—they ate the chocolate, clasped the crosses to their chests, and carefully divided the euros among themselves, proclaiming the coins to be “really cool.” Then we put the treats aside so we could dive into a story about Jesus together. I didn’t give the Irish booty another thought until I got home later that night and received this exact text from one of “my girls” named Sheri: \none of the things i feel the worst about was when i stole my dads rare coin collection so i could get high. But with no gift for father’s day yet i now have the best gift i could give him, a new rare and cool coin! That’s how Jesus works! thanks lisa\nDuring my next visit, Sherri explained how deeply ashamed she’d been of stealing from her father because unlike almost everyone else in her life, he’d never given up on her. She’d worried about what—if anything—she could get him for Father’s Day because she didn’t have much money. Then she beamed at me and said, “But then you showed up and gave me that rare and precious coin which is the perfect Father’s Day gift. I can’t wait to give it to him on Sunday!” \nLeft speechless and close to collapsing into a blubbering heap, I handed her a small velvet bag containing every single foreign coin I’d dug out of my dresser after receiving her text, and said, “Why don’t you give him these, too?”\nI’m continually amazed by how redemptive our Redeemer is, lavishly covering our mistakes with the cape of His mercy, faithfully promising us a glorious future that will not be limited or defined or tarnished by the past. This is the resounding theme in today’s reading:\n“‘Be strong; do not fear! Here is your God… he will save you.’ Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped. Then the lame will leap like a deer, and the tongue of the mute will sing for joy, for water will gush in the wilderness, and streams in the desert…”\n– Isaiah 35:4-6\nJust as God proved Himself faithful to rescue and restore our ancestors, the theocracy of Israel and King Hezekiah, so will He always prove Himself faithful to us. He will bring us to our forever home. \nHowever dry and parched your emotional landscape may feel this season, don’t despair. Because when the rain of God’s reign inevitably falls, your life will bloom.\n \n\nLisa Harper is a master storyteller with a masters of Theological Studies from Covenant Seminary.

Theodore Roosevelt said “comparison is the thief of joy,” and boy, was he right. When I start comparing my belongings or influence or talents with others’, I always walk away feeling unsatisfied. I stop seeing all the ways the Lord has blessed me—all the things I have to be grateful for—and instead focus solely on what I believe is missing in my life.\nAs I’ve opened up to others about my struggle, I’ve discovered that I’m far from alone. It seems many women have internalized a critical voice eager to tell them how they don’t measure up as a wife, friend, mother, or employee.\nAt first I thought the antidote to this horrible feeling was to believe in my own “enoughness”—to  raise my self-esteem, so to speak. Certainly the enemy relishes in our feelings of inadequacy that hold us back from the freedom promised in Christ (Romans 8:2). But as hard as I try to speak truth to myself, to remember that I’m valuable as a daughter of God, it becomes far easier to measure myself by the world’s definition of its values, like status, wealth, beauty, and social media followers.\nI’ve come to realize that the true antidote to my feelings of inadequacy is the voice of the Lord. His Word lovingly reassures me that, though my sinful condition causes me to fall short of “enough,” I don’t have to be—because He is.\n“You are God—You alone—of all the kingdoms of the earth.”\n– Isaiah 37:16\nHe is enough. Not me, not you, not admirable King Hezekiah, not that friend with the seemingly perfect Instagram life. Yahweh, the Lord of all, He is the only One who can deliver us. Freedom is found not in finally perfecting ourselves, but in surrendering to Him.\nI still play the comparison game from time to time. I see people and believe they have it all together, which promptly triggers a storm of discontent within me. I find myself longing to be just a little more like them, hoping that will finally bring me satisfaction. But behind that temptation is an even deadlier lie: Maybe I don’t really need God after all. Maybe I can get to the point where I’m good enough on my own. Maybe learning to be self-sufficient isn’t such a bad thing. \nThe story of King Hezekiah reminds me that even the most powerful people can’t save themselves. No matter our circumstances, what we all need is the mercy of Jesus. Christ lived the only perfect, wholly worthy life and submitted to a painful death on a cross so that we could participate in His resurrection. True freedom for us can only be found in surrendering to God’s mercy and strength.\nHear the voice of the Lord today as He gently calls His children to turn to Him, to rest in Him. He alone is God. He alone is enough.\n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

One 43-second phone call was all it took to reroute my morning commute and all future plans. My favorite person was gone, leaving a void too large and a shock too real to swallow. I wasn’t sure what else to do but to keep driving, allowing the quiet backroad to usher me out of my once-present joy and into a whole new reality.\nI pulled into my usual office parking spot with an unusual, aching sound caught in my throat. I felt paralyzed by the news, but somehow hurried inside anyway, my fingertips throbbing as I slammed the car door. Rebecca was already there, standing in the doorway, waiting to receive my sadness.\nWhen I’d been introduced to Rebecca just a few weeks prior, I’d been wearing my first-day-of-work finest. Our shared love for showtunes had grown from a quiet, excited discussion to loud, harmonized renditions of all our favorite songs (with assigned parts, of course). Over a shared lunch of red pepper soup and tossed salad greens, we began brainstorming names for the baby she was expecting in the spring. But neither of us was expecting the news that would come sooner.\nThe 43-second phone call had sparked the need for a 5-hour trip—one Rebecca graciously offered to drive. As I sat in the passenger seat of my little blue car, I didn’t fully realize that God had given me the comfort I needed in the form of a person. But this was hardly the first time He’d come to comfort.\nExile had forced the Israelites to leave the life they loved, and without warning. I don’t know where they were when they found out, but I’ll bet the news left them dumbfounded, not knowing where to go or what to do with their grief. To whom could they take their heartache? \n“Comfort, comfort My people,” says your God.\n“Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and announce to her that her time of forced labor is over,\nher iniquity has been pardoned,\nand she has received from the Lord’s hand double for all her sins.”\n– Isaiah 40:1-2\nGod was standing in the entryway of the Israelites’ new lives, offering the promise of comfort and an end to their suffering. They didn’t know it would come in the form of a person—much less a baby and ultimately, a cross—but it certainly would. “For as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so through Christ our comfort also overflows” (2 Corinthians 1:5).\nThe best comfort in our grief comes not from answers to stand behind, but from those who will sit with us in our pain. The incarnation of Christ gives us both. The places His body were pierced on the cross created vessels for the Father’s comfort to flow to us. Because “it is finished,” we are comforted (John 19:30). \nPraise the Lord for giving us a Person. “Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort” (2 Corinthians 1:3).\n\n",

But somewhere between getting my college degree and buying our first house, Pluto got bumped from true planet status on a technicality. I’ve never gotten used to rattling off the names of the heavenly bodies and stopping short at Neptune.\nRecently I was bemoaning Pluto’s tragic and seemingly unstable galactic status when my husband laughed and reasoned with me, “Raechel. Pluto hasn’t changed. Nothing has changed about what it’s made of—it’s just that the people who have never actually been to Pluto don’t call it a planet anymore.”\nI bet you feel a lot like Pluto sometimes. I do. For better or worse, we allow someone who doesn’t know us—someone trillions of miles away—to define us. We receive the world’s labels and live at the mercy of everyone else’s “technicalities.” We trade the truth we know about ourselves for a lie, and go on living misunderstood, mislabeled, or just plain forgotten.\nHow can we halt this orbit of lies? How can we respond when we’re pretty sure some of the unfortunate (or downright awful) labels the world sticks to our chests are technically true about us?\nLet’s turn to God’s Word together. Let’s let the One who made us tell us what we’re made of and what we’re made for. Only God has the ability to define you, so let’s see how He defines you.\nHe calls you beloved (Romans 9:25).\nYou are His treasured possession (Deuteronomy 7:6).\nYou are His child (John 1:12, Romans 8:17).\nYou are free (Galatians 5:1).\nYou have been redeemed (Ephesians 1:7).\nYou have been and will be restored (1 Peter 5:10, Colossians 1:13-14).\nYou have been and can be forgiven (Hebrews 10:17, 1 John 1:9).\nThat’s not all. Your God—the One Hebrews 13:8 tells us is forever unchanging—He not only names you, He pursues you and cares for you personally.\nWe see this pursuit in the book of Isaiah. And painful as it is to watch God’s people refuse Him, chapter after chapter, it is all the more astounding to watch as God loves them still. He “who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it, who gives breath to the people on it”—He is the one who appointed a Savior to be “a covenant for the people and a light to the nations, in order to open blind eyes, to bring out prisoners from the dungeon” (Isaiah 42:5-7).\nThat’s why, even in the midst of threat and uncertainty, God tells His people to do something extraordinary—He tells them to sing! “This is what I will do for them,” we read in the text (v.16). And then the words our approval-seeking hearts long to hear: “I will not forsake them.”\nAnd He won’t. Scripture makes it clear.\nHe knew each of your days before you were conceived (Psalm 139:16).\nHe has your name written on the palm of His hands (Isaiah 49:16).\nIt is your name —yours!—which He has called “mine” (Isaiah 43:1).\nIt is your head on which He numbers each strand of hair, and your tears of which He keeps count (Matthew 10:29-31, Psalm 56:8).\nIt was for you He died while you were yet a sinner (Romans 5:8).\nThe world will label you all your life. Tall, short, smart, bossy, ugly, pretty, worth it, and not. But here is the only label that truly matters:\n“Now this is what the Lᴏʀᴅ says—\nthe one who created you, Jacob,\nand the one who formed you, Israel—\n‘Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;\nI have called you by your name; you are mine.’”\n– Isaiah 43:1\n\n",

Actors Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were charming as per usual, and as they sang and danced across the screen, the audience seemed to buzz along with the energy of the film’s message: Don’t settle. Chase your dreams. Pursue your passions. Follow your heart. \nIt’s a message that speaks to our deepest longings. We want to cry out in unison, “Yes! This!” We want a life lived to the fullest.\nWe all have dreams and desires. Our heavenly Father knows the longings of our hearts just as surely as He knows the number of hairs on our heads (Luke 12:7). But our hearts can lead us astray (Jeremiah 17:9). It can be a struggle to know if our desires are from the Lord or from our brokenness.\nAs a counselor, I often hear people say, “If I just had _____, I would be happy.” You can fill in that blank with a job, a possession, a relationship, or any number of different things. We’ve all fallen prey to this way of thinking.\nThe trouble with putting all your hopes for happiness in a dream is that the dream will, at some point, fall short of what it promises. You get the new job, and six months later you feel restless again. You start a promising relationship, but still feel a crushing loneliness. You lose the weight, but still struggle to see your beauty and worth. \nWe are always unsatisfied when we look to this world to satisfy us. Only God can satisfy our desires for peace, justice, and beauty. Only God can fulfill His promises. We create idols when we worship people or jobs or dreams, as if they have the power to save us.\nWhy do we still ache for what God has already promised? Because we live in a fallen world. We cry out to the Lord for justice where we see injustice, and for peace where we see strife. As C.S. Lewis said, “If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world.” We feel unsatisfied because ultimately we are longing for heaven, where we will be in the presence of Christ.  \nOur hearts are made for the new heaven and new earth, where all of God’s promises will be perfected. But even in this present time, we get a taste of heaven because we live in a time of “already and not yet.” God has already defeated death but His full plan has not yet reached its great culmination. God has already fulfilled His promises in the coming of Christ, yet we still live in a broken world that leaves us feeling unsatisfied. God has already executed justice for all, and yet injustice will linger in this world until He comes again.\nWhen you feel tempted to look for satisfaction outside of God, remember that your loving Father is the only one who can fulfill your heart’s desires. There is no god besides Yahweh (Isaiah 44:6). For now we live within the tension of this temporal world and our eternal home, but the Lord has fulfilled His promises in Jesus and He will come again to set all things right.\n“Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay each one for what he has done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”\n-Revelation 22:12-13\n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Isaiah 46:1-13, Isaiah 47:1-15, Psalm 71:17-19, Proverbs 19:21\nI forgot a friend’s name the other day. She’s a real, live, good friend of mine. We’ve laughed together. We’ve cried together. We’ve lived near one another and far apart—and the other day I forgot her name. I was talking to someone about a conversation I’d had with my dear friend, and my mind just blanked. I felt like I was groping in the fog for something I knew the shape and form and content of intimately, but could not bring it to mind.  \nHave you ever felt like this with God? I have. I know His attributes, know His many names, know His Word, and yet I forget. I grope in the fog for some semblance of the God He seemed to be at other times in my life. But because I’ve missed His presence or it’s been a while since we’ve talked, I tend to forget Him and His character. \nIsaiah 46 was given to a forgetting people from an unforgetting God. It was given to a people who had tried to be righteous and found themselves lacking. It was given to a people who had chosen their own opinions, their own gods, and their own ways over the God who had chosen them before the creation of the world. The people who were loved by God had forgotten Him, His ways, and His promises. \nThere have been so many times in my life when what I know of God—what I know to be true of Him—clashes with the murkiness of what my day-to-day life looks like. Many days my life seems to be at odds with the God I know, and I find myself doubting Him. I forget He’s good, and that my version of good cannot compare with His perfect knowledge of what truly is. I forget He is faithful, and that my version of faithfulness looks more like getting my own way instead of living according to His. I worship at the altar of today’s circumstances, thinking they’re the most important and most pressing of all. \nIsaiah 46 reminds me that God is on His throne and was seated there even as these words were uttered by Isaiah, even in the midst of such a long wait, and even as I read them today. God is unchanging. His character is inscrutable. His faithfulness and goodness are everlasting. Even when I forget, He remains. \nIf you’re prone to forgetting—whether names of friends or your car keys or the one thing you forgot to put on your grocery list—like I am, let this be a reminder to you: God, in His perfection, has not forgotten you, and He has not forgotten the promises He’s made to His people. It’s human nature to forget, but He’s given us His Word to remind us again and again of who He is and what He’s promised, of what He’s done and will do, and of how He loves His children.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Isaiah 48:1-22, Isaiah 49:1-26, Colossians 1:13-14, Hebrews 4:12\nRecently, I have felt a loneliness and isolation that I’ve never quite known before. It’s not that I’m alone. I’m not. As a matter of fact, I’m often surrounded by people. And yet, in a way that can only be described as wandering in a desert, I do feel alone. Have you ever felt that way? Like you were wandering aimlessly, directionless, wondering if you would make it back home? \nI imagine that’s how the Jews felt in the Babylonian exile: defeated, alone, fearful, maybe even abandoned. Their faith was lacking (see Isaiah 48:1), but the truth was they were not alone. As Isaiah prophesied, God desired to get their attention.\n“Listen to this, house of Jacob—those who are called by the name Israel…” (v.1).\n“Listen to Me, Jacob, and Israel, the one called by Me…” (v.12).\n“All of you, assemble and listen!” (v.14).\n“Approach Me and listen to this…” (v.16).\n“This is what the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel says…” (v.17).\nThese aren’t merely hopeful suggestions from God. He was commanding their attention—not just to rebuke them, but to comfort them in their exile. Sometimes God uses these moments of loneliness and isolation to eliminate distraction so we might turn to Him. \nIsn’t this like our God? We fail to listen, we lack faith, but He continually pursues us. God reminds those who feel fearful, defeated, and alone that He is the faithful one—He is a covenant-keeping God. All of His promises are “yes” in Christ, and ultimately found in the gospel (2 Corinthians 1:20). \nSo, what does this mean for us? \nIn our despair, the Lord reminds us that He has not forgotten us. Even if a mother may forget her nursing child, the Lord will never forget us—He will restore (Isaiah 49:15,18). He comes to meet us in our despair. And just as Jesus healed and comforted those He saw in distress, He has compassion on us today. Christ is the ultimate servant, bringing salvation to all who turn to Him.\nAnd so we lift up our tired hands and strengthen our weakened knees, for we know the truth (Hebrews 12:12): God is near. He comforts us by the presence of His Spirit and in the promises of His Word. \nFor the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any double-edged sword, penetrating as far as the separation of soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It is able to judge the ideas and thoughts of the heart.\n– Hebrews 4:12\nThis is good news! May this knowledge lead us all to sing for joy, for our God “has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son He loves. We have redemption, the forgiveness of sins, in Him” (Isaiah 49:13; Colossians 1:13-14). There is no greater comfort than this. \nNo matter how alone we may feel, the truth is that is God is near and is never callous toward our pain. His desire is to comfort, encourage, and heal our hearts. Today and every day, He offers us the perfect, unending peace that can only be found in Him.\n\n\nTrillia Newbell is the author of Enjoy: Finding the Freedom to Delight Daily in God’s Good Gifts, Fear and Faith: Finding the Peace Your Heart Craves, and United: Captured by God’s Vision for Diversity.

Though the piece would have little value to most, to me it was a priceless heirloom—a gift from my great-grandfather to my Granny years before I was born. A simple yet costly purchase that still spoke silently of a humble farmer’s extravagant love for his beloved bride. \nI’d been looking forward to having that cherished part of my grandparents’ lives in our home. But as the auctioneer began his chant, it became apparent I wasn’t the only one with an affinity for my Granny’s hutch.\nThe bidding rapidly escalated and then swept past my “top-dollar” limit. My heart raced in unbelief, but I pressed forward, affirming with every nod my determination to claim that prize. But eventually, with tears of regret streaming down my face, I lowered my number and signaled “no” to the auctioneer’s insistent plea. I’d lost the battle; the only remaining piece of my Granny’s life would belong to another. \nDevastated, I glanced up and met the eye of the auctioneer as he bellowed, “Sold!” He seemed to be looking at me—but no, he was looking beyond me. I turned, expecting to find the new owner of the coveted hutch, but instead, I met the tender gaze of my beloved grandfather. “The hutch is yours, girl,” he whispered, as he quietly handed me his bidding card. “I knew how much you wanted it.”  \nTears flowed as I began to piece together all that had unfolded. Someone who had deeply loved me all my life had been fighting for me all along, working on my behalf, though I’d been totally unaware of it. Just as loss and utter defeat seemed to have won the last word, my defender was revealed. \nThe last week of Jesus’ life must have seemed similar to those who followed Him. With every fiber of their being they believed He was the Messiah. Their hearts found peace knowing the prophecies foretold that their Messiah would also be the conquering King. \nYet before their eyes, Jesus was being horrifically humiliated. He had been wrongfully condemned by several kangaroo courts and subjected repeatedly to public shaming. Maligned, brutally scourged, He was ultimately put to death by crucifixion. \nWhy?\nWhy was Jesus not defending Himself?\nWhy had the Rescuer not rescued Himself?\nWhy was our Messiah not putting an end to this dreadful atrocity?\nWhy was a brutal, hate-filled humanity allowed to lead the Promised One as a lamb to the slaughter?                                                                                                                      \nTo limited eyes that can only see what’s temporal, it seemed as if all was lost—that nothing remained but indescribable loss and utter defeat. But sin and death would not have the final word. Concealed from the disciples’ human eyes, a battle of magnificent proportions was being waged and won for all eternity. The Father was redeeming those enslaved by sin through the crushing of Jesus, our Messiah. \nNo one rescued Jesus from the suffering that purchased our redemption. No one came to His defense. No, He chose to suffer so that the price for our sin would be paid in full. Even now, He is conspiring for our good.\nHallelujah, our Defender has come!\n\nCarrie Gaul is a biblical correspondent for Revive Our Hearts.

Lewis \nSometimes, life can be exhausting. We run around trying to accomplish all the things, maintain all the relationships, and solve all the problems. We rarely look up to consider anything but our own present circumstances. \nIt’s a struggle to connect the physical life with the spiritual. Why would I bother thinking of others, or looking to Christ?\nGod knows this about us. He knows we are a bunch of selfish, hungry stinkers with tunnel vision. He connected the physical and spiritual for us in the person of Christ. Christ became low to make His dwelling among us.\nWhat does it mean to become low? C.S. Lewis once said, “If you want to get the hang of it, think how you would like to become a slug or a crab.” And that’s the flavor of it. Imagine becoming a slug and trying to convince the other slugs that redemption is at hand. Prepare ye the way of the Lord, you slugs! They’d probably just sigh and slime away.\nThat is what Christ did for us. He became low for our sakes. He gave up His glory and endured all manner of earthly suffering. Because of this, we gain everything.\nWhy do I let the details of the physical world obscure this most important spiritual fact? Because I’m like a slug trying to understand geometry. It’s hard. This is why I need reminders. I need to read these dear words: \n“But He was pierced because of our rebellion, crushed because of our iniquities; punishment for our peace was on him, and we are healed by his wounds.”\n– Isaiah 53:5\nJesus knew we needed redemption. From the beginning of our existence He had our redemption planned out. \nHe endured sickness for our healing. He suffered loneliness for our redemption. He withstood wounds for our comfort. He braved pain for our peace. And if that wasn’t enough, He experienced separation from His Holy Father in order to bring us, wretched slugs, back into His presence. \nThanks be to the One who left everything so we could become one with Him.\n\n",

The entire city was experiencing an “unprecedented heat wave” of 80-degree days, which to us felt like a welcome reprieve from the sweltering weather we’d been suffering in Tennessee. On the second to last day of the conference, we noticed another couple at our table smirk when the facilitator apologized yet again for the weather, and quickly struck up a conversation about our common hatred of humidity.\nAs it turned out, they were from Atlanta, and since we only had a few minutes to chat, the couple asked if we wanted to join them that night for dinner. They’d had reservations for their anniversary at an acclaimed waterfront restaurant for more than six months, but the wife assured me that she could call and get the hostess to add two more seats to the table.\nWhat unfolded that night over dinner was nothing short of the gospel. As the sun melted into the water, our conversation went wide and deep, covering the vast terrain of our lives. We tasted grilled octopus and braised lamb shoulder and homemade pastas. When the entrees arrived, Patrick and I ordered the most expensive bottle of wine we could afford, hoping to offer a small gesture of gratitude to our new friends for sharing their anniversary reservation with us. I still remember looking at the price and wondering if we’d gone a little overboard. But this night was special; there was something providential about it. \nSeveral hours later, I noticed the waitress drop a black folded book in front of our new friends. I elbowed my husband in the ribs hard—the universal wife-code for ‘get out your wallet!’—but it was too late. The check had been paid. A signature was already on the bottom of the receipt. \n“But,” I started, embarrassed. “That was a really expensive meal. We wanted to…” I looked to Patrick for back-up. “…This was your anniversary!”\nIt’s hard to think of the extravagance of that night without imagining the extravagance of Jesus. Isaiah paints us a picture of the most opulent love—a free gift available to anyone and everyone. No one is excluded. No one is unwelcome. Our God says, “Come!” He prepares a table before us with food—not just for our bodies, but for our souls. And it costs us nothing. The view from that table will be magnificent because our host, our friend, is the Son of God. \nIsaiah and Jesus invite all to come. But as the bride of Christ, we, too, can join in offering the invitation, which echoes from the Old Testament straight through the book of Revelation:\nThe Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say, Come! Whoever is thirsty let him come and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.\n– Revelation 22:17\nLet nothing keep us from joining in the feast. For as gracious as our God has been in His invitation, not one of us can fathom the goodness He’s prepared for us—for all who love Him—in the days to come (1 Corinthians 2:9). \nThanks be to God.\n\n\n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Isaiah 57:1-21, Luke 12:4-7, Ephesians 2:11-22\nI did not grow up in a Christian home. If we did attend church, we did so sporadically—but most Easter holidays, for sure. I had heard a smattering of Bible stories and knew about Jesus through the Catholic grade school I attended. And even then, I was drawn to Jesus.\nI will never forget that day in the third grade when we had an Easter observance, the Stations of the Cross, during the school day. Our class filed into the sanctuary and began moving from picture to picture, pausing at each image that depicted Jesus on the day of His crucifixion. By the time we got to Jesus on the cross, I was in tears. Even hearing that He rose again didn’t comfort me. I couldn’t understand: how could something so awful happen to someone so good?\nStill, as moved as I was, I felt far from Jesus. I didn’t know Him and I didn’t know that I could know Him. I didn’t know that He came to earth to die for me, so that I, Kim, could be saved. In my mind, the classmates who could walk to the front and take communion were the ones who were close to Jesus. I had to sit in the pew as they got up and filed past me. They were included, while I never thought I was.\nIn college I met friends who had grown up in church. On a couple of occasions, I attended Sunday service with them, watching as they opened their Bibles, knowing exactly where to turn at the pastor’s direction. They could quote Scripture and knew references to people and stories throughout the Bible. Once again, I felt far from Him, while others got to be near.\nMaybe that’s why I so love the heart of God in these words: “‘Peace, peace to him who is far and to him who is near,’ says the LORD, and ‘I will heal him’” (Isaiah 57:19).  In Isaiah, God is revealing His plan for the world; salvation would extend to all nations and all people, not just His chosen people, Israel. \n“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life” (John 3:16, emphasis mine). Jesus’ earthly lineage came through the people of Israel, but He is the eternal God. Before the foundation of the world, His divine plan was for Jesus to be Savior of all.\n“Peace, peace to him who is far and to him who is near” is joyous news for us all. Jesus’ arms are open unto us no matter where we’re from, how we were raised, or what we’ve done. So often we feel far from God because of things we’ve done, but the truth is there’s nothing that can that can separate us from the love of God (Romans 8:39).  \nIt is Jesus who makes it so. His death on the cross paid a debt we could never pay. In Him, we are forgiven and able to dwell closely with our Lord, ever near. Peace with God through His Son is a gift overflowing with mercy, love, and grace. This is the God who beckons to us, not once, but twice—peace, peace. By the power of His Spirit may we turn to receive it and to rest in Him.\n\nKim Cash Tate is the author of several books, including Though I Stumble (2016) and Cling: Choosing a Lifestyle of Intimacy with God (2017).

    "devo_summary": "\nBY She Reads Truth\n\nText: Matthew 21:1-11\nIf you grew up with Bible stories, you know the challenge it is to read a familiar passage of Scripture with fresh eyes. When we come to a story like the Good Samaritan or Noah and the flood, our task, as Bible scholar Kenneth Bailey used to say, is to “rescue truth from the jaws of familiarity.”\nSo it is with the Easter story. Most everyone knows Jesus died on the cross. It is one of those facts essential to the story, like how we know the Titanic sank or that Lincoln was shot in a theater. But the story of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection is drenched in details of remarkably significant insight which affect not only what we understand about the story, but also about Jesus Himself. \nHow clear are you on the foundational story of Jesus’ death and resurrection? If you are a Christian, your confession is that Jesus died in your place and paid for your sins with His death. But why was He crucified? Was He a martyr? How secure did He make your salvation?\nPrior to His arrest, Jesus said, “No one takes [My life] from Me, but I lay it down on My own. I have the right to lay it down, and I have the right to take it up again” (John 10:18). This was not simply a passing statement. It was a promise that Jesus was going to the cross on purpose. \nDuring this last week of Lent, as we make our way through the final chapters of Isaiah, our supplemental readings will trace, in real time, the path Jesus walked that last week of His earthly ministry. On Monday, we will read what happened on the Monday before the Resurrection, on Tuesday we will read what happened on Tuesday of that week, and so on.\nOur hope as we read these scriptures is that we would know Christ better through the careful study of His Word, and that we would understand that His death and resurrection were purposefully endured for our salvation. His victory over death frees us to serve Him with vigor in this life, secure in the salvation He has accomplished.\nAs you read, see how He laid His life down. He did this for you.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Isaiah 58:1-14, Isaiah 59:1-21, Matthew 21:12-22\nI never had a rebellious phase.\nAs far back as I can remember, I’ve been a “good girl,” running my life on the straight and narrow, delighted to follow the rules. I loved to please my parents, my teachers, and my coaches because I was devoted to maintaining my pristine reputation.\nDue to my well-practiced, people-pleasing ways, Christianity came easily to me. Religion offered one more list of boxes to check, all affirming my goodness. The only problem with all this box-checking is that as much as I honored God’s law, I did not understand His grace. I understood it on a head level, but not on a personal one. Not in my heart. I couldn’t grasp the urgency of it, or my deep need to be rescued by a Savior. Because, if I was really being honest, I didn’t think I needed rescuing. I was doing Christianity pretty well on my own.\nThat’s the beautiful irony of my story. While I lived my good Christian life of following the rules and doing all the right things, I only proved the depth of my brokenness. The truth was, my rule following was my rebellion. It was my own attempt to justify myself. As Tim Keller once suggested in his book The Prodigal God: Recovering the Heart of the Christian Faith, my rebellion wasn’t against God’s law but against God’s grace.\nWe witness this same kind of brokenness in Isaiah 58. Although the Israelites engage in the godly discipline of fasting, it only reveals their sin all the more, to which the prophet had this to say: \n“Yet on the day of your fasting, you do as you please\nand exploit all your workers.\nYour fasting ends in quarreling and strife,\nand in striking each other with wicked fists.\nYou cannot fast as you do today\nand expect your voice to be heard on high” (vv. 3-4).\nAccording to Old Testament scholar John Oswalt, the Israelites were fasting for the wrong reason. They were not doing it to “express gratitude and submission to God” but were instead doing it “for the very same reasons the pagans do, to manipulate God to act in their favor” (Oswalt 625). This manipulation is why the Israelites are confused at God’s silence: “Why have we fasted, and you have not seen it?” (Isaiah 58:3). They thought they had done everything right. They thought fasting was a guarantee of divine favor. Why wasn’t God holding up His end of the deal?\nIn response to their entitlement, God had this response: \n“Surely the arm of the Lord is not too short to save,\nnor his ear too dull to hear.\nBut your iniquities have separated you from your God;\nyour sins have hidden his face from you,\nso that he will not hear” (Isaiah 59:1).\nIn short, God was not the one who broke His word. The Israelites’ “good deeds” point right back to their sin. They are unable to keep His commandments, try as they might. Thankfully, as Oswalt explains, “God will come and do for his people what neither they nor anyone else can do for them” (Oswalt 636).\nThe truth is, we all go through a rebellious phase. Some of us rebel against the rules and some of us rebel against the rescue, but the end result is the same: separation from God. Our only hope is to name and to confess our rebellion, in whatever form it takes. Because no matter how good and well-behaved we are, our arms are most definitely too short to save ourselves.\n“The Redeemer will come to Zion,\nto those in Jacob who repent of their sins,”\ndeclares the Lord.\n– Isaiah 59:20\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, and mom of two boys.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: Isaiah 60:1-22, Isaiah 61:1-11, Matthew 25:31-46\nMy grandmother’s Sunday best was almost always paired with a favorite accessory—her geese pin. Given to her by my grandfather decades prior, it wasn’t until I was a teenager that I learned the meaning behind it: geese are birds that mate for life. The pin represented his vow to her, a promise he kept.\nThe cherished pin, brass with two geese flying in the same direction, is one I saw my grandmother wear many times as she sat in the front row of the church pews, watching my grandfather as he sang solos in the church choir. It’s what she wore during their 50th wedding anniversary party, smiling as they snapped a picture together under the backyard tree that had witnessed their marriage blossom. It could be found pinned to her black dress on the day of my grandfather’s funeral, and on her shirt most of the days that followed.\nAlthough my grandmother was usually in the kitchen making a coconut cake while my grandfather was picking bell peppers from his garden, they were always in hollering distance from one another. They came as a packaged deal. On the rare occasion you’d see them apart, maybe in the grocery store or on a fishing boat, their contribution to any conversation was always spent bragging on and missing the other. After my grandfather was gone, I think the geese pin helped my grandmother follow the routine they’d established together. It was a prized piece of jewellry, displaying the treasure of their union. \nIsaiah also proudly displays a prized possession: the picture he’s been given of final glory. He rarely describes people and God as separated because his sight is set on the vision of being united. On the rare occasion he does see them apart, in our earthly aching and hoping, he doesn’t stop seeing us in the light of God’s radiance. We have been given a similar promise to that of the geese: eternal life together with Him. It is God’s covenant to us, one He will keep—the unity that was and is and will be again, forever.\nArise, shine, for your light has come,\nand the glory of the Lord shines over you.\nFor look, darkness covers the earth,\nand total darkness the peoples;\nbut the Lord will shine over you,\nand His glory will appear over you.\n-Isaiah 60:1-2\nIsaiah’s words help us look forward to heavenly things, but they do more than that. They give us a lens to look through in the meantime. Yes, the Lord will shine over us, and His glory will appear over us for eternity. Hallelujah! But until then, friends, let us not overlook the current rays of light, for they will only continue to grow and stretch and expand. Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord shines over you. His glory is radiating daily, currently, actively.\nLike my sweet grandmother’s pin, Isaiah’s words are a remembrance of what we have and what we can look forward to. May we bask in the rays of His glory, for we know we’ll see them shining fully soon.\n \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Missy Fuller\n\nText: Isaiah 62:1-12, Isaiah 63:1-14, Matthew 26:1-16\nIsaiah 62 reveals God’s promise of restoration for His people. I could read this passage of Scripture 1000 times and never get sick of it. \nThe book of Isaiah as a whole is a tough read. The prophet tells of the coming destruction of Judah (3:8) and their captivity in Babylon (39:6). But think of this: the entire book of Isaiah is written before one Babylonian sword is drawn against Judah and Jerusalem. Before their destruction Isaiah tells the people of Judah of God’s promise to restore them.\nOur God always tempers His righteous judgment with loving compassion (Psalm 145:8). He plans deliverance and restoration for His people even before He disciplines them. Even before God inflicts judgment, He plans to restore.\nGod promised to restore Jerusalem, and He sealed that promise when He gave her a new name. This is significant. Names are a core part of our identity—often the first thing we share about ourselves. Names embody who we are and what we are about.\nWhen God changes a name, He also changes an identity.\nAbram became Abraham (Genesis 17:5). From an “Exalted Father” to “The Father of Many Nations.” God changed Abram’s identity as a respected man with no son of his own, to one with many descendants, including the promised Messiah.\nJacob became Israel (Genesis 32:28). From “He Grasps the Heel” (or “Deceiver”) to “He Struggled with God.” Jacob’s identity changed from one marked by deceit and manipulation to the father of God’s chosen people.\nJerusalem was called “Deserted” and “Desolate,” but as God redeems, He promises to give Jerusalem a new name (Isaiah 62:2). She will be called:\nMy Delight Is in Her\nHoly People\nThe Lord’s Redeemed\nCared For\nThe City No Longer Deserted\n(vv.4,12).\nWhat an identity shift!\nThis is the character of our God: He redeems. He rebuilds. He renames. While He disciplines, He also restores (Hebrews 12:6; Joel 2:25). We are never too far gone for the reach of His restoration. No wonder Isaiah can’t help but shout and proclaim God’s promises for Judah: \n“I will not keep silent because of Zion, and I will not keep still because of Jerusalem, until her righteousness shines like a bright light and her salvation, like a flaming torch” (Isaiah 62:1).\nIt is good to proclaim God’s faithful restoration within our own circumstances, regardless of what they may look like today. As we cling to the the truth of who He is, we can rest—because His restoration has already begun.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Annie Downs\n\nText: Isaiah 63:15-19, Isaiah 64:1-12, Isaiah 65:1-25, Matthew 26:20-50\nA few nights ago, I threw myself down in my big fluffy chair to read Isaiah 65. It had been a long week with things going “differently” than I’d expected—meaning, EVERYTHING FELL APART. When days like these come to an end, all I know to do is make myself a cup of chai tea with almond milk, diffuse some essential oil that promises to ease all my stress, and sit down, Bible open, to whatever passage someone has encouraged me to read, just hoping it might make a difference in my attitude. \nThose nights. You know the ones I’m talking about? The nights when you start spinning, thinking about how things could be going better, how life seems harder than it should be and isn’t exactly what you thought you were signing up for. As I read from Isaiah that night, I talked to God about what I was seeing on the page and how I longed for Him to show up. \nHonestly, it’s not that I need Him to fix everything that feels broken in my life. Sure, sometimes I want a quick, easy fix to my problems, but I know what planet I’m living on. I know things here are hardly ever easy and never ever perfect. Jesus said it would be hard, but that He had overcome (John 16:33). Why don’t I remember that verse more often? \nTrust me: there are plenty of nights when I just want to turn on Netflix and let episodes of Friends run back-to-back until even the screen seems to ask, “Are you still watching?” But this night was different. I knew I needed the quiet, not the noise or some other distraction. I knew I needed to connect with God, not pull away from Him. \nIt was a forced behavior, to be sure, but that happens in all relationships, doesn’t it? Moments when you want to isolate, but then you remember the commitment you’ve made, and somehow love leads you back toward relationship instead of running away from it.\nSo I drank my tea and I read. And there it was: New heaven. New earth. New.\nYes, I thought, I want NEW. I want a world where destruction—of places, of culture, of dreams and hearts and hopes—is barely a distant memory. I don’t know if it was God’s Word, the diffusing oils, or a combination of the two, but my heart started to calm down.\nI think that’s what these pages and stories from Scripture are meant to do for the people of God—to remind us of what God is actively doing today and what He’s promised to do when He makes all things new (Isaiah 65:17). He is the One who answers even before we call. He is the One who acts while I’m still asking. He is the One who promises He’s present in any and all circumstances.\nOn that Tuesday night, before I’d even finished calling on Him, God answered me with peace and connection—with His very presence. \nI think that will be the best part of the “new” that’s to come: God’s palpable and pervasive presence, uninterrupted by my sin or attitude or even Netflix. There’s so much about our eternity that is going to be beyond good, but being face to face with the God who hears and sees and answers and loves me completely? That’s the part I look forward to the most.\n\n \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Isaiah 66:1-24, Matthew 27:32-50\nIt feels counterintuitive to call this day good. “Good Friday,” we say, but for a long time I could not understand why. How is the murder of the world’s only sinless person—the only truly, wholly good human—good?\nIn a very real sense, it was awful. And not just awful, but evil. The dark hearts of men put Jesus to death, causing Him to suffer and mocking Him at each step. It was the height of injustice, a banner day for cruelty. But it was not the end of the story.\nIn his response to today’s reading over at our brother site, He Reads Truth, author Barnabas Piper explains the paradox this way:\n“It was the darkest of days, the most unjust and evil of days. Yet it was good—good for you and for me and every other person who has ever lived. For through the evil, God brought life and hope to the world.\n“Isaiah 66 describes God comforting His people like a mother. He promises to wrap them in His arms and bring them peace and joy. He promises they will flourish like grass and that peace will flow like a river.\n“How? By way of Good Friday—a perfect sacrifice to satisfy God’s need for justice. Through the evil committed against Jesus came all our joy. We have peace. We can flourish. There is no distance between us and God. He wraps us up in His arms like a mother embraces her children.”\nYes, the darkness of this day is real, and it is painful. It should cause us to wince, to mourn, to grow quiet as we gaze soberly upon the wounded Christ hanging on His cross. It should cause us to repent of our sin—the sin He carried and suffered for in our place. But it should also cause us to worship. It is by His wounds that we are healed (Isaiah 53:5). It is His suffering that brought us peace (Isaiah 66:12).\nGood Friday was the day the promised Messiah secured salvation for sinners. It was the day God’s holy and just wrath against sin was satisfied by the sinless sacrifice of His Son. It was the day the curtain of separation from God was torn so that all could enter in.  \nYes, this day is good. Thanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Matthew 27:62-66\nToday is Holy Saturday. It is a sad day, a somber day, a real day on the timeline to the resurrection. But it is not an unimportant day. Indeed, the opposite is true.\nHoly Saturday is a part of God’s fulfillment of His promise to redeem and restore His people. Holy Saturday is not defeat; it is the quiet but confident prelude to victory.\nSo what happened on the Saturday of Holy Week? Again today, we “Shes” find our hearts encouraged by the words of our He Reads Truth brothers—these written by pastor and author Russ Ramsey. Russ answers the question this way:\n“That Saturday is one of the most unique and overlooked days in the history of the world because it was the only full day where the body of the crucified Son of God lay dead and buried in a grave. \n“Holy Saturday can be a forgotten day in the Easter story. But when we look at the few verses the Gospels give us accounting for it, we find this was by no means a forgotten day to the chief priests who had handed Jesus over to death.\n“During His earthly ministry Jesus said many times that He would die in Jerusalem at the hands of the chief priests, but on the third day He would rise again (Matthew 12:40; Mark 8:31, 9:31, 10:34). Of course, the chief priests scoffed at this. But they didn’t forget it. And on the Saturday of Holy Week, Jesus’ prediction occupied their thoughts in such a way that they couldn’t leave it alone.\n“The chief priests couldn’t seem to dismiss out of hand the possibility that Jesus might have known something they didn’t. They went to Pontius Pilate and explained that while Jesus was clearly an imposter, His disciples might try to steal His body and fake a resurrection. In a moment of prophetic irony, Pilate said, ‘Here is a guard of soldiers. Make the tomb as secure as you can’ (Matthew 27:65).\n“Jesus’ uncommon strength, coupled with the supernatural darkness that settled over the land during His crucifixion the day before, set His accusers on edge. So on Holy Saturday, the chief priests made the tomb as secure as they could. Why? Because a resurrection would only cause people to believe in Jesus more. \n“But then, shouldn’t the resurrection of the dead have that effect?”\nOn Holy Saturday, the chief priests made the tomb as secure as they could. But no amount of earthly might would keep Jesus in the grave. \nToday we remember that Christ’s death was a real part of the story, but it was not the end of the story. Sunday was coming.\n \n",

The guards lay shocked and crumpled on the ground where they once stood to guard the dead body of the man they’d mocked as “King of the Jews” just days before. The Marys—Mary Magdalene and the other—approached, surely shaken by the scene they’d come upon.\n“Don’t be afraid,” the angel told them, “because I know you are looking for Jesus who was crucified. He is not here. For he has risen, just as he said.” And then? “Go,” he said to the women. “Go quickly and tell his disciples” (Matthew 28:5-7).\nSo they went, and quickly. Leaving the tomb “with fear and great joy,” the women hurried to tell the twelve-turned-eleven the news. Could it be?\nAnd then they saw Him. \n“Greetings!” Jesus said to the women, and they fell to His feet in worship. \n“Do not be afraid,” He said. “Go… tell my brothers…”\nSo they went, and they told. And the eleven went on to Galilee as instructed, heads hanging low yet hearts beating with hope. Could it be?\nAnd then they saw Him. \nSome believed, some doubted. All worshiped. \nThe risen Christ was standing there in front of them, the ones He came to save. The saving work—all of it—was finished (John 19:30). \nAnd here’s what He said to them, to us (Lean in close):\n“All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.” There was and is and will be nothing or no one more powerful than Jesus. He sits at the right hand of God the Father, His reign without end. \n“Go, therefore,” Jesus continued, “and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you.” Go. Tell. \n“And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:18-20). He is with us and will never leave us. Remember. Always. \nOh, the glory of this blessed day—the day our Christ walked out of the grave, saying, “Greetings!” How can we but celebrate?\nOur promised Savior has come, and His work is complete. We cannot add to it or take away from it. It cannot be undone (Ephesians 2:8; John 10:28). \nOur Redeemer has risen. “Death has been swallowed up in victory.” The risen Jesus is the “yes” to all God’s promises, echoing throughout eternity (1 Corinthians 15:54; 2 Corinthians 1:20). \nOur hope is eternally secure. The Holy Spirit is the down payment of our future glory sealed in Christ (2 Corinthians 1:22).\nWe will not find our Lord in a tomb. He has risen, just as He said.\nDo not be afraid.\n\n",

We are free to observe it and we are free not to. So what is it? Why have Christians around the world, for over ten centuries, attended Ash Wednesday service as a way to begin the liturgical season of Lent?\nAsh Wednesday is a day of repentance. It is a day where we take a page from the Book of Job and repent in dust and ashes (Job 42:6). We remember that we are mortal.\nDuring an Ash Wednesday service, people make their way to the front of the church as a minister moves down the line holding a bowl of ashes made from the palm fronds of the previous year’s Palm Sunday celebration. The minister might whisper into the worshipper’s ear as he smears ash in the shape of a cross onto the worshipper’s forehead: “Remember, mortal, that from the dust you were made, and to the dust you shall return” (Genesis 3:19).\nSome ministers put it more plainly, saying simply, “Remember that you have to die.”\nWithout Christ, these are hard words. With Christ, they are a reminder that, though our bodies will one day return to dust, we have the hope of the resurrection. Still, even for those in Christ, these words are a sober reminder that only Jesus’ death and resurrection could pay the wage of our sin and reconcile us to our Maker.\nThe ashen cross is an outward sign of both repentance and hope. It is a way to repent of our rebellion against God and “confess our sins one to another” (James 5:16). It is appropriate to enter into a season of celebrating the finished work of Christ by assuming a posture of repentance, confessing our need for a Savior.\nOn Ash Wednesday we admit our limits and acknowledge the brevity of this life. Whether in a formal Ash Wednesday service or privately in our homes, let’s use the first day of the Lenten season to remember that from the dust we were made and to the dust we shall return.\nRuss Ramsey is one of the local pastors who serves She Reads Truth & He Reads Truth by providing theological oversight and pastoral counsel.

It is a historical record of real events with real people in real places and in real time. Indeed, as Paul makes plain in his letter to the church at Corinth, if Christ’s birth, death, and resurrection did not actually take place in time and space, then all is lost. We of all people are most to be pitied (1 Corinthians 15:19).\nGod not only authored the Bible’s true story, He’s its lead actor. Behind the flood, the call of Abraham, the Exodus, the rise of King David, the exile and return of Israel, and every other redemptive act—God is present and the prime mover. On every page of the Bible, God is the hero of the story. As the author and hero of redemption, God calls His people to remember the great things He has done (Deuteronomy 8:1-3).\nOne of the means God used to stir the mind and imaginations of His people to remembrance was a calendar. From the Day of Atonement to the weekly Sabbath, to the annual feasts and festivals, God calendared salvation history in order to help the prone-to-forgetfulness Israelites relive their redemption each year (Leviticus 23).\nRightfully so, the shadow of the Old Testament calendar faded in the bright light of Christ’s fulfillment (Colossians 2:16-17). Although God issued no new calendar requirement for the New Testament church, He gave His people the freedom to order their days while maintaining the commitment to remember the redemption of Jesus Christ (Romans 15:4-9, Galatians 3:1-4, Romans 6:5-11, 2 Peter 1:3-11).\nNot as a biblical requirement but as a discipleship tool, the early church began marking the days by the life and ministry of Jesus (Advent to Ascension) and the life and ministry of His church (Pentecost to Ordinary Time). Many Christians throughout the centuries have kept the practice, finding it a helpful means of remembering and connecting to both the life of Christ and the reality of His church, reaching around the world and across generations.\nIn that spirit, we invite you to join us for the forty days of Lent, as we read Scripture and prayerfully prepare for the heartbreaking and heart-mending climax of the Christian year—the crucifixion and resurrection of our Savior.\nPastor Nate Shurden is one of the local pastors who serves She Reads Truth & He Reads Truth by providing theological oversight and pastoral counsel.

Lent is the time we let our legs give way in their weakness and let our best efforts crumble to the floor in a heap. Lent is the time where we stop pretending and start confessing. It is a sober yet hopeful path to the heart of the heavenly Father, who “is patient with [us], not wanting any to perish” (2 Peter 3:8-9). And it all begins with a turning. \nLent begins at repentance.  \nThe word “repent” as it is used in the New Testament comes from the Greek word metanoeō, which means to change one’s mind, to turn from sin. “Repent and turn back,” Peter said to the crowd at the temple, after the lame man went out healed and leaping, “so that your sins may be wiped out” (Acts 3:19). \nNot “repent and do better” or “repent and save yourself,” but repent and turn back. Repent and turn to Jesus.\nSince we’re touting honesty here, can I honestly tell you that sometimes I’d rather not? Turn back, that is. When I do, I must see my sin for what it is—a stain I can never remove on my own. It is an offense to the God who has loved me faithfully from before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4-5). It is a stripe on the back of the Son who took the guilt of that very offense upon Himself and suffered in my place (Isaiah 53:5). To turn back means acknowledging that. \nThe sinful place where I stand—a place that is not God-honoring or God-facing, a place that does not acknowledge that God is God and I and the world are not—is a place I can get comfortable in if I let myself. The sights and sounds grow familiar, and I become accustomed to the view. I decide I’ll clean up the mess myself, and I refuse to turn back until I’m finished. \nTo turn may be simple, but it is not easy. The prophet Joel understood this. He described turning from sin as an emotionally laden event, accompanied by signs of deep sorrow and utter dependance. “Turn to Me with all your heart,” he said, acting as a spokesperson from God to His people (Joel 2:12). You and I have seen the dark corners of our hearts, so we question the invitation.\nBut questioning the invitation means questioning the love of our God. Leaving our feet stuck in the mire of sin means refusing the finished work of our Savior. \nThe Lord who calls us to repent and turn with all our hearts already knows our hearts. He stands ready to forgive, to remove our armor and our masks and clothe us with His righteousness (Isaiah 61:10). He invites us to come quickly and honestly, with no hope other than Him. He invites us to turn from our sin, even when the turning itself is a struggle.\nLent is not for dressing up our sin in an effort to make it look less like sin, or succumbing to the despair that we’ll never get it right. Lent is for turning away from sin altogether. Lent is for stripping ourselves bare and standing uncovered before the God who made us, who knows and loves us fully, to say,  I’m here, Lord, under all my disguises. \nI’m still the sinner you rescued, a sinner who is nothing without you. O Lord, rescue me still.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Joel 2:13, 2 Chronicles 7:13-14, John 1:19-34, 2 Corinthians 7:8-10\nI am the human mama to a baby puppy and, so far, things aren’t going so great.\nA dog trainer told us, when Pup was a mere eight weeks old, that we had only one job when it came to training a dog this young: teach him to come when we call his name. “No problem!” we said, and the trainer went on her way.\nWell. \nIt’s been almost eight weeks since then, and if Pup has run off from us once, he’s run off from us a hundred times. It sounded simple in theory: preoccupy him with something, call his name, and give huge praise and a treat or two when he comes running. We’ve tried this, really we have, but do you know what our problem is? Consistency. I use his name for other things like, “Pup! Don’t chew on that!” or “Pup! Stop biting me!” or “Pup! No peeing on the floor!” And I’m not too keen on the idea of toting rewards around with me at all times like a walking dog treat dispenser.\nLike I said, things aren’t going so great. And it isn’t the pup’s fault; it’s mine. That adorable, stubborn animal won’t come when I call because I haven’t given him much reason to.\nObviously, this analogy can’t go much further. You and I aren’t dogs, and our heavenly Father certainly isn’t a lazy, annoyed pet owner. But as silly as it sounds, I can see myself in that puppy when he’s looking back at me, the moment of decision in his eyes, trying to decide whether to respond to his master’s call or ignore it. (And lately, he ignores it.)\nRepentance is not just turning away from something (our sin); it is turning to Someone (our God). Recognizing and acknowledging our sin is critical, but that is not repentance in full. With the turning away, there must be a turning to.\nIn his second letter to the early Corinthian church, Paul admits that he caused them grief with his first letter and that he wasn’t sorry about that. Because the grief they felt over their sin was appropriate grief—Paul called it “godly grief”—and it turned them to repentance. It turned them back to God.\nThe God whom the Corinthian believers turned to nearly two millennia ago is the same God who invites us to turn to Him today. We don’t have to wonder if He is trustworthy or consistent, if He’ll do what He says He will do. Like them, we can look to His Word and to His Son to see exactly who He is. \nWhen I want to know who it is I’m running to, I open my Bible.\nI read about the God who created mankind in love and then pursued them when they turned away, bridging the gap between their sinfulness and His holiness at His own unfathomable cost. \nI read the stories of the God who never once violated His covenant to His people, despite generations of their broken promises to Him. \nI read about the life of the God incarnate who entered this broken world by His own choosing, embodying love, justice, mercy, and hope as He walked among the seeking and the sick, the prideful and the weary. \nWhen I read about this God, I see in black and white that what the prophet Joel said was, and still is, true: “He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in faithful love” (Joel 2:13). He is the God who hears, forgives, and heals (2 Chronicles 7:14).\nWhen I turn from my sin only to turn to myself or to the world, I feel distraught and paralyzed. It can truly seem like there is no way out of the death all around me. But when I turn from my sin to look at the cross—when I turn my eyes to “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world” (John 1:29)—I have life. Turning from my sin to myself brings despair, but turning from my sin to God in repentance brings “seasons of refreshing” (Acts 3:19).\nFriend, our God is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8). He calls us by name and is pleased to receive us, to wash us clean, and to bring abundant, everlasting life to our souls. \nGod stands ready to show you mercy (Isaiah 30:18). Turn to Him today.\n \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: John 14:15-21, Deuteronomy 5:33, James 4:7-10, 2 John 1:6\nGrowing up in the religious South, I’ve too often thought of faith as one of those moving walkways in the airport. The point was not the walking or the journey along the way; the point was getting to the destination—heaven. Or, to put it bluntly, not hell.\nBeing a Christian meant picking the correct lane and facing the correct direction. No deviating to the left or right, no passing Go or collecting $200. No obvious need for a Savior or real understanding of grace. Just a beeline for the pearly gates, with a little tithing and a lot of church attendance thrown in for good measure.\nAren’t you thankful Jesus didn’t come to give us empty religion? He came to give us Himself. The invitation Christ extends is an invitation to a relationship with Him.\nRepentance is not a box we check so that we end up on the right side of eternity; repentance is an everyday event, a manifestation of an ongoing relationship with God. We turn from our sin and turn to God, and we walk with Him. The turning is the first step, but the walking is a continuous motion. And, contrary to what we may fear, it is not something we do on our own.\nThe night before Jesus was crucified, He sat with His disciples around a table and said to them, “If you love Me, you will keep My commands” (John 14:15). Those twelve men could not have known the full weight of Jesus’ statement at the time, but in hindsight, we can see just how hard that would be. Like them, you and I know how difficult it is to walk steadily in the way of Christ. We know how often we fall, just like Adam and Eve and every generation after them fell, and just like the imperfect disciples sitting around that table. When we hear “if you love Me, you will keep my commands,” we may wonder if we do.\nWe aren’t perfect. That’s why the perfect Savior came. Jesus came to give the Father glory and to give us Himself. And what He gave, the world could not take away.\nThey took His life, but He gave us His Spirit. They buried Him in the ground, but He rose out of that grave and later into the heavens, where He lives so we might also live (John 14:16,19). Yes, Christ calls us to walk in obedience and love, but we do not walk alone. “I will not leave you as orphans,” Jesus said to the disciples that day. “I am coming to you” (John 14:18).\nOur command-keeping is not about proving to Christ that we belong to Him. It is what happens when we are His. When we repent of our sin and turn to God, we receive the Holy Spirit as His never-leaving, always-living gift to us. “He is the Spirit of truth”—a Spirit the world cannot receive or understand, a Spirit that teaches and reminds us of the things of Christ (John 14:17,26). He is our Helper, our Counselor. \nWith hearts so prone to wander, we may be tempted to stand still in our fear or uncertainty. But repentance is not a passive position; it is an active and humble pursuit. It is turning from sin, turning to God, and walking in obedience—all by the grace and mercy of a good Father who loves His children.\n\n \n",

All of those things.\nBut all those things are for His glory.\nWe can fast from food while feasting on our own pride. We can withhold indulgences while noting them as accomplishments. It may not be easy to fast, but it is quite easy to make our fasting about us, isn’t it?\nWe don’t set out for it to be this way, but we are sinners and thoughts of self come so naturally. Even our most selfless deeds—our efforts to deny ourselves and take up our cross—require God’s grace.\nJesus tells us in Matthew, “Whenever you fast, don’t be sad-faced . . . put oil on your head and wash your face, so that you don’t show your fasting to people but to your Father” (Matthew 6:16). And in 1 Corinthians, Paul tells us, “Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for God’s glory” (1 Corinthians 10:31).\nBefore knowing ourselves or training behaviors or even petitioning Him—the first reason we fast is to give glory to our Maker. It’s why we’re here. It’s why we have breath in our lungs. It’s what is asked of us in anything that we do.\n“You do not want a sacrifice, or I would give it;\nYou are not pleased with a burnt offering.\nThe sacrifice pleasing to God is a broken spirit.\nGod, You will not despise a broken and humbled heart.”\n-Psalm 51:16-17\nHe who knit us together, sees and searches and knows every beat of our hearts (Psalm 139:1-2, 23; 1 Samuel 16:7). Imagine Him, our Creator and Father, being presented with gifts from our heart to His, knowing full well they were never really intended for Him. Our sacrifices are empty apart from our God. They are utterly meaningless outside of communing with Him.\nAnd so, we fast to know Him. Because that gives Him glory.\nWe fast to become like Christ. Because this glorifies the Father.\nWe fast—whatever it is we’re fasting from—because He is God and we are not.\nWe fast for Him.\nTomorrow we will read accounts from God’s Word about fasting as intercession, and on Friday, Scripture will help us understand fasting as humility. But today, let’s hold the mystery of biblical fasting in front of us and understand it simply as a means and opportunity to bring glory and honor to the One who desires, deserves, and demands our worship.\nWhatever we eat or drink, whatever we don’t eat or don’t drink—whatever we do—let’s do it all for the glory of our God. Because our fasting and feasting, our prayer and confession, our meditation and our study—it’s all about so much more than us. It is about His Kingdom. It is about Him.\n“I do not know You God because I am in the way.\nPlease help me to push myself aside.”\n-Flannery O’Connor, A Prayer Journal  \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nText: Matthew 3:16-17, Matthew 4:1-4, Acts 13:1-3, Ezra 8:21-23\nDo you remember the story of the four guys who dropped their paralytic friend through a roof in order to be healed by Jesus? (It’s not a part of our reading for today, but you’ll find their story in Mark 2:1-12.)\nThis very hopeless man was at Point A, and Jesus—the man they’d heard was healing many—was at Point B. Things would have stayed this way had his friends not interceded. They carried him across town and knocked on the door of the home where they knew Jesus was teaching.\nIt turns out, they weren’t the only ones with this big idea. The Bible says the home was so full of people eager to hear Jesus’ message, even the doorway was blocked (v. 2). Their intercession mission might have been short-lived had it not been for the persistence of these four friends. They did whatever they could to get their sick friend to Jesus—even if that meant carrying him to the roof of the house and cutting a hole through the branches and dried clay above where Jesus was teaching.\nJesus forgave the man’s sins right away because, no matter how sick we are, our sin is always more profound. He showed the house full of people that day that He has authority to both forgive sins and heal bodies, and he did both for the paralytic whose friends carried him to Jesus.\nThis is intercession. It’s working and sweating and not stopping—forsaking all worldly sensibilities because people need Jesus. \nThe Bible is filled with accounts of men and women fasting as a means of earnest intercession. Sometimes they intercede before long journeys, like Ezra did before Israel’s return trip to Jerusalem from exile (Ezra 8:21-23), or as the early church did before sending men out on missionary journeys (Acts 13:1-3). Other times, the intercession was in the midst of trouble, like when Nehemiah heard of the destruction occurring to the place and people of his hometown. He tore his clothes and fasted and prayed on their 800-miles-away behalf, asking the Lord to help them:\n“As soon as I heard these words I sat down and wept and mourned for days, and I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven . . . let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for the people of Israel your servants . . . ”\n-Nehemiah 1:4-6\nFasting is a tangible way we can declare our utter dependence on the Lord. It can also be a way we lay others at the feet of Jesus. \nWhen I think about the men who pursued Jesus tirelessly on behalf of their friend, and Nehemiah who petitioned and fasted and repented before the Lord on behalf of his people, I remember that however compassionate those men were, God’s compassion is greater still. Because I serve a God of compassion who answers the persistent petitions of His people (Nehemiah 2:1-9) I can approach the throne just as boldly, just as reverently, and with the same persistence, and be heard by the Almighty God upon whom no prayers are wasted.\nWe fast because our need is great and our God is greater. We fast in reverence of this truth. In fasting, we are saying to God, “Our spiritual need is greater than our physical discomfort and the supply for both comes from You alone.”\nWe fast because He listens. \nLet’s lower the physical and spiritual needs of others on a mat before Jesus, trusting and remembering that He has all authority in heaven and on earth, to heal our bodies and forgive our sins.\n\n",

It’s what we do all day long.\nWe need to sleep, we need to get up.\nWe need to get dressed and out the door.\nWe need to be on time. We need to do excellent work.\nWe need to eat well, treat others well, be patient, be kind, beware of dog.\nWe need gas to keep the car running, caffeine to keep the day running.\nWe even need air.\nIt’s pretty fair to say that all of this—most of it, anyway—falls squarely under the “need” column. There isn’t much here that has been indulgently plucked out of the “want” list (maybe caffeine, but that’s debatable).\nThe truth is, when our backs are up against a wall, we all have one chief need—whether we’ve been given the mercy of recognizing it or not.\nWe need Christ. \nMore than air. More than we need to pick up our kids from school. More than we need to get groceries or to land that job.\nWe’ll talk about Jonah more next week, but I can’t help but think of him in the moment he was thrown overboard in the storm of disobedience. As he sunk to the “foundations of the mountains” and the “earth with its prison bars closed” behind him, he begged for the salvation of the Lord (Jonah 2:1-9). He didn’t pray for air or even for life—Jonah prayed for Yahweh. Back against the wall, Jonah realized his greatest need in the whole world was for God Himself.\nThis is humility. It is the mercy of realizing we are nothing apart from God. \nToo often, we fail to realize our need for Him, and instead assume He needs us and our sacrifices. Like Israel, we put on a formulaic fasting show, expecting our God to dance in response. We ask, “Why have we fasted, but You have not seen? We have denied ourselves, but You haven’t noticed!” (Isaiah 58:3).\nBut we don’t fast to make things work for us. We fast to avail ourselves to Him. \nThe fast God calls us to is nothing short of hungering for another world—a world of perfect peace, provision, and satisfaction. Our fast reflects that other world and pursues it, even today. It connects us with both the heart of God and the needs of the world in a way that deepens our desire for the coming of His Kingdom here on earth, but also moves us to action, to be the hands and feet of Christ.\nLet’s pray today asking the Lord—the God of Israel who requires loyalty and not sacrifice—to remind us of how desperately we need Him, more than anything else. When He shows us our need, we will find in ourselves a longing which no food can satisfy.\nPutting aside our earthly comforts and even our needs, let us demonstrate our humility saying,\nFather, use us. We are here to set ourselves aside and to serve at your pleasure: to break the chains of wickedness, to set the oppressed free, to share bread with the hungry, and to care for the poor and the homeless. There is nothing on this earth that can sustain us. Be our sustenance today. Show us what a life of dependance on you alone looks like. Amen.\n“If I find in myself desires which nothing in this world can satisfy,\nthe only logical explanation is that I was made for another world.”\n-C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity\n\n",

Literal phone calls, voicemails, emails, texts, tweets, messages—not a day goes by that I don’t feel the pressure to respond to someone in some way about something. \nI remember things being simpler when I was small. The way to reach someone at my house was to call the landline or, as was more common in our neighborhood, just come on over and knock on the front door. The point of contact was just that: to come into contact, to touch, to be near one another. \nSometimes it seems we’re further away than ever from family and friends. I can’t remember the last time I hugged someone just for the sake of hugging them. These days we call because we need an answer, words of comfort, information—rarely just because we need nearness. \nPsalm 73:28 says, “The nearness of God is my good,” and these days, I need to remind myself of these words often. This week alone, our little family has a hundred different prayers that necessitate a hundred answers: \nWill my husband get the job? Will we move? Will we lose money on our house here? What if they knock down our cozy 1800s farmhouse to build a high rise? What if we have to leave another church and our friends? Will we find a new church? Will we have friends? Will we stay here? For how long? \nMy counselor recently asked me how God and I were doing these days. I abashedly told her that sometimes it feels like God and I aren’t on speaking terms: I’m speaking to Him, He’s not answering, so I’m shrugging and moving on. “Do you feel far from him?” she asked. My answer was truthful when I said no, that I know He is near. “That isn’t what I asked,” she said. “I asked if you feel far from Him?” And sometimes, I do.\nI read in Psalm 145:18, “The Lord is near to all who call out to Him, all who call out to Him with integrity.” With integrity. I don’t know what integrity looks like in this season. I know I wear the robes of righteousness gifted to me from Christ, so I couldn’t be more righteous if I tried (Isaiah 61:10). But integrity? Do I come to the Lord with my palms empty, my heart open, my eyes set on Him, and the integral understanding that God is good, right, true, and faithful? \nDo I come with integrity when I call on Him?\nIntegrity means “authentic, whole, and undivided”—and if there’s one thing I know to be true of me, it’s that my heart is utterly divided. I don’t come to Christ just to be near Him or to know His nearness. I come to Him because I want information. I want direction. I want answers. I want resolution. \nBut prayer is not just the act of asking and receiving; it is the act of being. It is the act of knowing. It is the act of coming near to God with integrity—with a heart that is whole and undivided in its attentiveness to Him. It is knowing and believing that He is near and He hears us, that He is always faithful in His love for us, even when we don’t feel it (Psalm 25:6). \nPrayer is less about the words we say and more about the availability of our Creator and King, and the opportunity each of us has to call on Him. \nDo I feel near to God? No, not always. But I know He is near to me.\nLore Wilbert is the Director of Community and Formation at Park Church, Denver, and writer at Sayable.net. Find her on twitter @lorewilbert.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nText: Matthew 6:5-13, Matthew 6:19-24, Luke 18:1-8, Luke 18:15-17, James 4:2-3, 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18\nI woke up this morning thinking of the prodigal son, the one who demanded an inheritance and got it, and the elder son who stayed home minding his father’s business but not partaking of the father’s blessings (Luke 15:11-32). There have been many times where I know I’ve taken all the good my heavenly Father has given me and squandered it, finding myself face-down in a pigpen. But today I am the elder son, staring at the fatted calf and not daring to ask for it.\nLest you think I have never asked for the fatted calves of God’s blessing, let me correct you because I have. I have asked for them a thousand times and a thousand times seen them paraded before me and given to others. It is difficult to resent when God gives to those you love, but it is not often difficult to resent the God who gives it to them.\nJames said, “You do not have because you do not ask” (James 4:2). But I find more often that I do not ask because I do not have—nor do I have reason to believe I should have. I have swallowed the scant riches of the poverty gospel, certain I will never deserve nor get what I want, and so why even ask? I know others, though, who are prone to ask for wild things and then get them too—scarred and battle worn, but always, always, always winning. They ask because they have proof that the getting happens in the asking.\nI cannot think it is wrong to ask boldly, but neither can I bring myself to ask boldly, so I am often caught in the tension of simply not asking at all. \nHow do we bring our petty petitions to the owner of everything and ask for a pittance of His favor? I reread the passage from James again and again, and each time I envision a God who withholds until my motives are right. But every time I think my motives are right, I trip myself up on the high ground of good motives. I come up short with my righteousness and I come up short in what I receive. How do I practice prayer when I fall short in the asking and in the receiving?\nWhen Jesus taught His disciples to pray, He said to pray like this:\n“Give us today our daily bread . . .”\n-Matthew 6:11\nToday. Daily. Theologians espouse that a repetition of words is meant to convey, “Listen to this, really listen to this.” What was Jesus saying to His disciples? It would be more efficient and just as clear to say, “Give us our daily bread,” or “Give us today our bread.” But it would not convey something more important than efficiency and clarity—a posture of dependency.\nJesus taught His disciples to pray with the confidence of those who believe their God gives bread daily, and with dependance on the God who brings just enough for today. \nRemember the Israelites and the manna? They were instructed: Gather only enough for one day, except for the day before the Sabbath, then gather for two days. Anything more will spoil (Exodus 16). Here, in the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus is saying, Take your empty hands to the God who fills them with exactly what you need exactly when you need it.\nAsk for that fatted calf. Ask for your Father’s gifts. Ask for whatever you want in His name (John 14:13), and ask regularly, faithfully. But ask for it knowing this: He gives exactly what you need when you need it. Daily bread, not a lifetime’s worth. Today’s portion, not tomorrow’s. Thanks be to God.\nLore Wilbert is the Director of Community and Formation at Park Church, Denver, and writer at Sayable.net.

There are three solid options on the table, one of which is to stay here in Denver, in the home we love, in the city we felt God calling us to a year ago. The others take us to the opposite side of the country, near where we both grew up. Neither option to move back east seems best today. I don’t know what to ask for, and I don’t know what to pray. My prayers lately resemble something like this: I don’t know, but You do, so just do it quick—even if it hurts.\nI feel weak of praying. I don’t mean tired of praying, I mean weak in it. Praying feels like the weakest thing I could do and the most necessary. Never in all my life have I felt so out of control of my own life and person—and I’m weak for it. I feel bruised, sucked in, spit out, worn over, trampled, even crushed. I am like one with dry mouth trying to ask for a drink of water; more desirous than ever, and unable to form the words with a parched throat and cracked lips.\nMy will is strong, my body is weary.\nIn these moments, I’m tempted to keep quiet because God knows my prayers anyway; He knows the words I’d say if I could. In Romans 8:26, we read, “The Spirit also joins to help in our weakness.” It would seem more fitting if it said, “The Spirit will carry us along in our weakness,” but it doesn’t. It says, “joins.”\nThe Holy Spirit comes to us, gets down in the trench with us, imbeds inside us, melds against and with us, and helps in our weakness. This changes things. A parched person need not cry out for water if one who is satiated joins her pleas, groaning alongside her for what she needs.\nThis is what the Holy Spirit does for me and you. He dips down and hears those earnest and difficult cries, and He, who knows the will of God, takes every petition to the Father who gives good gifts (Matthew 7:11). Our prayers are not powerful because we ourselves are powerful. The power of prayer lies in the power of God.\nI do not know what to pray for as I should, but I know the Holy Spirit joins with me. He knows what I need better than I ever could.\n“Don’t worry about anything, but in everything, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses every thought, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.”\n-Philippians 4:6-7\nLore Wilbert is the Director of Community and Formation at Park Church, Denver, and writer at Sayable.net.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nText: Luke 15:11-32, Romans 5:6-9\nThis is part of a 7-day series on Jonah in the Lent 2016 reading plan. \nThe smiling felt-figure man next to the big, blue whale on the storyboards of our childhood: this is how many of us know the prophet Jonah. His story is memorable and fun to tell, a classic case of what not to do when God calls. But like all redemption stories, there is more to the book of Jonah than meets the eye. There is more to see than the irresistible spectacle of a man being swallowed whole by a fish.\nMatthew Henry says the book of Jonah is “best understood by those who are most acquainted with their own hearts.” Because at its heart, Jonah is a story of salvation. It’s not about the fish. It’s not about the Ninevites. It’s not even about Jonah.\nThe book of Jonah is about the saving work of Christ and the boundless mercy of our sovereign God.\nJonah’s story foreshadows Christ’s sacrifice (we’ll see Jesus Himself draw this parallel in next week’s reading), but it also goes a step further: it illustrates the unreasonable forgiveness available to us because of Christ’s sacrifice.\nA rebellious Jonah runs from God, repents when he sees of the vastness of his sin, and is pulled from the depths of his self-made pit by a merciful God.\nA wicked Nineveh, undeserving of God’s compassion, repents and receives the same mercy.\nLike the older brother in Jesus’ parable of the lost son in Luke 15, Jonah is angry at the Father’s unabashed display of mercy. He is ironically offended by God’s truly free grace—balking at the Lord’s mercy toward Nineveh while sighing with relief as he receives it for himself.\nBut grace is, by definition, undeserved. The distance between a sinful humanity and a Holy God can only be spanned by His saving mercy.\nLike Jonah, the lost son, and the Ninevites, we too are invited to come clean. We are invited to repent and return to the arms of a God who pursues us at our worst, rescues us from our darkness, and rejoices over us as His beloved child.\nMay we hear the Father’s call as we read Jonah’s story. And may we be drawn to repentance, running toward the only One who knows and restores our wayward hearts.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nText: Jonah 1:1-3, Psalm 139:7-12\n\nThis is part of a 7-day series on Jonah in the Lent 2016 reading plan. \n\nThe book of Jonah begins typically enough. Another prophet, another message of repentance from God to be communicated to the world. It’s like the first bars of a familiar song playing softly on your stereo… but then the record screeches to a halt.\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the prophet Jonah hears the Lord’s message and bluntly refuses. He doesn’t simply squirm like Moses and Elijah and Jeremiah when the Lord called them to something beyond their wheelhouse. Jonah straight-up does not approve this message. You see, Jonah had an “us vs. them” view of salvation: God’s mercy is for us, but it is definitely not for the wandering hearts of those dirty Ninevites. \nWe know about Jonah, most of us. We know that God called Jonah to preach repentance to a crazy-wicked city and that Jonah disobeyed because he didn’t think these people deserved God’s mercy. But before we read further into this book, let’s break out a map and see in black and white Jonah’s heart-and-body response to God’s calling.\n\nDo you see what I see?\nIt takes very little explanation, really. God spoke to Jonah in the general vicinity of Joppa (see “The Call” on the map), Jonah barely glances east toward Nineveh, before he boards the nearest boat headed as far west as he can imagine (toward Tarshish).\nAnd do you know what Jonah found in his escape? He found that nothing, not even his own dark, unwilling heart, can separate him from God. David discovered this, too, writing, “Where can I go to escape Your Spirit? Where can I flee from Your presence? If I go up to heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, You are there” (Psalm 139:7-8).\nHave you ever fled from the Lord? Ever sensed a strong tugging from the Holy Spirit, but chose to run in the opposite direction?\nThis is where we’ll leave Jonah today. But where will we find you?\nFriends, I encourage you to sit in quiet for a while right now. Tune out distractions and pray.\nAsk the Lord where He has called you and you have not obeyed. Repent of your disobedience and be forgiven. \nConsider the places and people to which He has called you and you have responded with obedience. Praise Him for His direction.  \nAsk the Father where He would lead you now. Who needs to hear His message of mercy today? \nMay we go in obedience and by His grace. May we have the courage to joyfully share the message of God’s salvation — a message that is just as much for the rest of the world as it is for our own souls.\nIf I take the wings of the morning\nand dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,\neven there your hand shall lead me,\nand your right hand shall hold me.\nIf I say, “Surely the darkness shall cover me,\nand the light about me be night,”\neven the darkness is not dark to you;\nthe night is bright as the day,\nfor darkness is as light with you.\n-Psalm 139:9-12 ESV\n\n",

Pulling the coarse blanket tighter and rolling over, sighing as he sank deeper into sleep. Perhaps the dark, warm cabin where Jonah slept creaked and groaned as the waves outside surged with increasing intensity. Meanwhile, the sailors above deck were left to scan the horizon, and anxiously glance up toward a dark, grey sky, heavy with the strength of the Lord Almighty. And as each man cried out to his own false god, the One true God was coming for Jonah.\nHe was running away, but God pursued him like only the Creator and Lord of the sea could: with a furious ocean tempest. Jonah tried to flee from the very presence of the Lord, believing he could hide out in an old boat heading in a new direction.\nBut our God is fierce and awesome in His pursuit. There was never any chance of Jonah hiding from Him. Even the inanimate dice the sailors used to cast lots pointed to Jonah as the one running from God (Jonah 1:7). All creation seemed to be shouting, “Return!” In the face of the deafening storm and sure signs, the sailors feared for their lives, and looked to Jonah with eyes of blame and hands ready to give him the heave-ho.\nGod uses wind and waves, pennies and dice; everything in creation stands by to obey its Creator. When we read about His greatness, we’re left in awe and wonder. But in real life, it can all be so terrifying in the moment.\nGod’s pursuit is relentless exactly because He is so loving. He could’ve crushed Jonah under a tremendous sea surge and found another man. Jonah had his chance, and he clearly took the coward’s way out, right? God gave him a clear-as-day instruction—something we all long for—and he ran like a frightened child in the other direction. Why didn’t God give up on Jonah?\nGod wanted Jonah. Goodness, isn’t that amazing?\nI sometimes feel like I’m a substandard version of the person who should actually be living my life. I often worry there is someone who would be a better mother to my kids, wife to my husband, friend to my friends. And the truth is, I do fall short. But despite my imperfections and failings, I’m the right mother for my children and wife for the husband God has so graciously given me. And I’m a good friend to those He’s gifted me with in this journey.\nGod gives specific callings to specific people. That means God wants me for my particular calling and life. It means He has specific plans for you too. Ephesians tells us “we are His creation, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time so that we should walk in them” (Ephesians 2:10).\nWe can’t escape God and His stormy gale of purpose. He pursues us with love that is filled with a beautiful intensity unlike anything else we have ever known.\n“Where can I go from your Spirit?\nWhere can I flee from your presence?\nIf I go up to the heavens, you are there;\nif I make my bed in the depths, you are there.\nIf I rise on the wings of the dawn,\nif I settle on the far side of the sea,\neven there your hand will guide me,\nyour right hand will hold me fast.”\n-Psalm 139:7-10\n\n",

Papa was a seasoned fisherman who always came home with a net full of snapper and stories, but they never included seasickness. I, on the other hand, could become nauseated at the mere mention of our packed pimiento cheese sandwiches or the squid bait blood splatters. You heard me. \nI’d spend most of my time on a half-bench in the fetal position, dreaming of still land and real bathrooms. So when I read Jonah’s story and about a storm hurled by God that was only getting worse and worse, I begin to reach for my saltines.\nThe boat’s floorboards must’ve groaned in protest with each violent rock and sway of the water. The helm would’ve been rendered useless, the compass indifferent, “as the ship threatened to break up” (Jonah 1:4). As the ocean continued to rise, the sailors’ knowledge and skill would’ve run dry in the face of the tempest. And whether or not the men were made physically ill by the storm’s churning, each was squirming in the waters of his own sin (Jonah 1:5).\n“What should we do to you to calm this sea that’s against us?” they asked Jonah (Jonah 1:11).\nI remember asking the first mate of the fishing boat a similar question. Surely there was a pill, lotion, elixir, balm, trick, cure—something, anything to soothe the sickness. His answer couldn’t have been more frustrating. “Look to the horizon,” he said. “Don’t look anywhere else until it’s over.”\nJonah’s response to the crew’s question was just as confusing.\n“Pick me up and throw me into the sea so it may quiet down for you, for I know that I’m to blame for this violent storm that is against you” (Jonah 1:12).\nImagine the mariners’ confusion. Certainly there had to be a better way, right? One that didn’t involve anyone getting hurt? So they began rowing, but the sea refused to let them go. Even the most well-prepared ship struggles to cross an unruly ocean.\nHow many ways do I try to life-jacket my own soul, but end up drowning it instead?\nThe sailors realized they couldn’t correct the sin that had started the storm; they had to throw it overboard. The same goes for us and our sin—except it would take more than throwing it overboard. Our sin would have to be crucified.\nThe men tossed Jonah into the sea, and they were saved from the water’s rage.\nAnother group of men nailed Christ to a cross, and we are saved from sin’s wrath.\nFor three days, Jonah was inside a fish. Death did not claim him.\nFor three days, Jesus was inside a tomb. Death did not defeat him.\nAnd by His victory, we are swallowed by grace and forever fixed to eternity. We don’t belong to death, either.\nWhen I row away from my rough edges, I’m also running from my rescue. We can stop running. We can rest in the One who came to quiet the storm (Mark 4:39). Even as the sickness of sin rumbles and stirs around us, may we glue our eyes to the horizon to see our coming Rescuer. Amen.\n“And they woke him and said to him, ‘Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?’ And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, ‘Peace! Be still!’ And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. He said to them, ‘Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?’ And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, ‘Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?’”\n-Mark 4:38-41\n\n \n",

It came crashing in like Jonah’s storm, and without much warning I found myself in the pit. Maybe you’ve been there too—in that place you can’t quite explain, marked by sorrow and shame. I had been walking with Jesus for most of my life, but I had lost all hope. I was caught in a tangle of darkness and despair.\nA friend encouraged me to press into Jesus. I wondered if I still knew what that meant.\nI was so painfully lost in shame and confusion that even the thought of picking up my Bible caused a wave of emotion I couldn’t bear to face. A part of me knew my friend was right: I needed Jesus more than anything, especially in the pit. But the lies were screaming at me so loudly, drowning out my best intentions, even turning my sorrow into physical pain. I just couldn’t drag myself into His presence.\nI wonder if Jonah shared in those same feelings of despair. He knew his sin had caused the storm, but I wonder if he thought the fish was how God was going to end his life.\nJonah was in the pit—quite literally in the depths. He was at the bottom of the ocean, inside a beast. Yet Jonah prayed from inside the fish, from the lowest of lows. \nBut did Jonah want to pray? Did he sit there pouting for two-and-a-half days and then finally admit his mistake, only to be immediately spit out on dry land? Or did he call on the Lord right away, then wait in silence for three days? Did Jonah pray because he felt his own brokenness, or just because that’s what a good Jewish man ought to do?\nWhether out of contrition or habit, whether upon entering the pit or on his way out—Jonah called out to the Lord. And then something remarkable happened:\n“I called to the LORD in my distress, and He answered me.”\n-Jonah 2:2 (emphasis mine)\nThe God who heard Jonah’s cry hears yours and mine—no matter the pit we find ourselves in and no matter how we got there. The God of the incarnation, who took on flesh to rescue His people—that God always comes after us. He uses whatever means necessary to bring us out of the pit, even if that pit is the stomach of a huge fish.\nLike the Lord pulled Jonah out of that fish and onto dry land, God pulled me up out of my own pit, one slow inch at a time. In time I was able to turn to Him in prayer. Painful though the process was, my only regret is that I didn’t call out to Him sooner.\nHave you ever wondered if the Lord’s hand can reach as far as you’ve fallen? \nRead Jonah’s story and have hope. God truly is faithful. He never gives up on us. Whether you’re new to the pit or you’ve been waiting on His deliverance for some time, approach His throne with the confidence that He hears you and will answer you (Hebrews 4:16). The God who left heaven to pursue you and rose from the pit to redeem you has not forgotten you. Thanks be to God.\n“But You raised my life from the Pit, LORD my God!”\n-Jonah 2:6\n\n",

And like most Mesopotamian civilizations, their culture was immoral and generally terrifying—temple prostitution, child sacrifice, abortion, and infanticide.  \nI love my ears and nose, so I understand why Jonah didn’t want to go.\nThese are the people who heard God’s call to repentance. These brutal eye-gougers! The Ninevites listened to Jonah and to God. And they repented. They stopped, stripped off their clothes, rubbed their faces in the fireplace, and gave up eating. They were desperate to get God’s attention.\nAnd they did get His attention. God had mercy on even these most wicked people. They didn’t know how wrong they were until God arrested them in their sin. But this is a story only marginally about about the repentant Ninevite hearts, and centrally about God’s mercy and forgiveness. \nGod knew the depth of their sin, and used Jonah to deliver a call to repentance. Astonishingly, the Ninevites listened, repented, and began fasting. \nFasting hurts: that painful ache in the stomach is hard to ignore. It’s tangible and practical repentance, and repentance must change how we live our lives. We turn from the things that give us false comfort, and only have God.  \nFor the Ninevites, fasting meant giving up their means of power and energy, and depending on God alone for power in a very real way. They humbled themselves publicly and didn’t hold back for pride or fear of what others would think. Even the king—who held an almost god-like status in the culture and had everything to lose—humbled himself, bowing before the one true God. It was a culture-wide repentance, extending from the greatest to the least.\nTheir repentance was not chiefly about their emotions, how sorry they felt, but about casting themselves wholly upon God’s mercy. It wasn’t about what they could bring to the table. Rather, they said, “Who knows? God may turn and relent” (Jonah 3:9). They recognized that repentance is about what God is doing, not what we can do. \nMercy is not a matter of merit; it is gift from God.\nGenuine repentance is a tangible 180-degree turn of the heart. In Jonah’s case, he made a literal about-face—repenting, turning, and traveling on in the opposite direction. God said, “‘Get up! Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach the message that I tell you.’ So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh according to the Lord’s command” (Jonah 3:2-3).\nEven though Nineveh was awful by any standard, God had mercy on them. I would’ve stubbornly agreed with Jonah that they were just too far-gone. But God’s grace and mercy reach even the blackest hearts. \nI’m with Paul, who claimed himself as the foremost of sinners (1 Timothy 1:15). I don’t gouge eyes out, yet pride, envy, and wrath are always within arm’s reach for me. “But I received mercy for this reason, so that in me, the worst of them, Christ Jesus might demonstrate His extraordinary patience as an example to those who would believe in Him for eternal life” (1 Timothy 1:16).\nThe story of Nineveh’s repentance is about God’s perfect patience, His deep mercy, and His profound forgiveness. Thanks be to God.\n \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Raechel Myers\n\nText: Jonah 4:1-11, Matthew 9:36, Matthew 10:29, Acts 11:15-18, Romans 5:6-11, Psalm 103:8\nThis is part of a 7-day series on Jonah in the Lent 2016 reading plan. \nAt the end of chapter four, we find Jonah throwing a childlike tantrum in response to God’s extravagant mercy on a city full of eye-gouging sinners—the same extravagant mercy Jonah himself received inside the gut of a fish (Jonah 2:10).\nThe Bible tells us in Romans 1:16 (and many other places) that Jesus Christ came to save the Jew and the Gentile—everyone—and that there is no distinction. But do you ever find yourself, like Jonah, subscribing to a gospel of entitlement? Or maybe God’s tender mercy toward anyone He chooses sits quite comfortably with you, but the call to love others in that same undiscriminating way is harder to swallow (see James 2:1-12).\nWhether regarding God’s love or your own, are you ever tempted toward a members-only mentality? \nWe are not entitled to God’s love. Not because of our nationality or upbringing, not because of our bank accounts or marital status, not even because of our charitable giving or our care for widows and orphans.\nScripture says that what we are entitled to is death.\nWhoa. It sounds harsh, but it’s true (Romans 6:23). And here’s why it is important to say this harsh truth out loud: we cannot know the depth of God’s grace if we do not know the depth of our need.\nI love how Matthew 9:36 describes God’s heart toward us, His needy children:\n“When [Jesus] saw the crowds, He had compassion for them, because they were weary and worn out, like sheep without a Shepherd.”\nDo you hear the tenderness in those words? Jesus saw those crowds of people, and He sees us, as we really, truly are: weary and worn out. Utterly lost and hopeless in sin and despair, and desperately in need of a loving Shepherd. And in His great mercy, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. And for Jonah. And for the people of Nineveh. And for all of the unlovables.\nChrist loves the unlovables. And we are all the unlovables.\nThe compassion the Lord shows the Ninevites stands in stark contrast to Jonah’s contempt for them. Yes, he had obeyed and gone to Nineveh like God commanded. But when the Lord’s purposes were fulfilled there, Jonah was enraged. The condition of his proud heart prevented him from seeing that, while the Lord had been pursuing Nineveh, the Lord had also been pursuing him. The Ninevites’ wickedness was a mirror, showing Jonah the ugliness of his own sin.\nUnderstanding the depth of our sin not only shows us the depths of God’s mercy, it enables us to pour out God’s love and compassion on those around us. For all have sinned and fallen short—including me, including you, including the prophet chosen by God to deliver the message of salvation to the entire city of Nineveh. All of us.\nIf we walk away from our reading of the book of Jonah with one thing, know this:\nGod’s mercy is far-reaching. It is deep and wide and for you. \nThanks be to God!\n“For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die—but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”\n-Romans 5:6-8\n\n",

This introduction to the series is written by our friend, a local pastor, Russ Ramsey.\nWho is Jesus Christ? God’s whole redemptive plan—along with our understanding of Easter’s significance—rests on the person of Christ.\nDuring Jesus’ earthly ministry, people answered this question in a variety of ways. Some said He was demon-possessed (John 10:20). Some thought He was a narcissist with delusions of grandeur (John 6:42). Others thought He was the prophet Elijah come back from his celestial chariot ride (Matthew 16:14.)\nWhen Jesus asked His disciples who they thought He was, Peter spoke up and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (Matthew 16:16).\nWe all need to answer this question. Who do we say Jesus is? \nC.S. Lewis, in Mere Christianity, said we really only have three options: Jesus is either a liar, a lunatic, or the Lord. He either intentionally made claims about Himself He knew were false, He was delusional, or He really was the Christ.\nThe Gospel writers answer this question. They present Jesus as a man who is very human. He experiences human feelings like hunger (Mark 11:12), grief (John 11:35), anxiety (Mark 14:34), and the need for solitude (Luke 5:16).\nThe humanity of Jesus, after all, is what qualifies Him to be a suitable substitute for us.\nBut the Gospel writers also present Jesus as fully divine. John includes eight “I Am” sayings from Jesus: occasions where Jesus uses the divine name God revealed to Moses at the burning bush to describe Himself (Exodus 3). Who is this divine Word made flesh who dwells among us (John 1:14)? John lets Jesus answer for Himself.\nThe “I Am” sayings focus specifically on Jesus’ relationship to this world as our Savior. \nHe is the Bread of Life who satisfies our nagging hunger for contentment (John 6:22-59). He is the Light of the World who frees us from walking in darkness (John 8:12-20). He is the Good Shepherd who keeps us from getting lost (John 10:11-31), and He is the Door through which God’s sheep enter into the safety of His refuge (John 10:1-10). He is the Resurrection and the Life so that, even though we die, yet shall we live (John 11:25). He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life so that we might, through Him, have access to God (John 14:6). He is the True Vine so that, when we are grafted into Him, His life flows continually to us as God Himself prunes and trains us to bear fruit (John 15:1). And He is eternal in His authority—at work in a Covenant of redemption that predates Abraham (John 8:31-59).\nIn this section of our study during Lent, we will unpack these “I Am” sayings from Jesus and consider together who He claimed to be as He made His way to the Cross for our salvation.\nWho do you say Jesus is?\nRuss Ramsey is one of the local pastors who serves She Reads Truth & He Reads Truth by providing theological oversight and pastoral counsel.

I have a secret. I love bread. You too? Let’s keep this under wraps from all our gluten-free besties, shall we? (Though I dare admit, they’ve cracked the code on gluten-free treats that rival the likes of Paula Dean’s confections.)\nNo matter your grain of choice, Jesus knew He would get the attention of women around the universe when He started talking all things bread. Since I’m a context junkie, let’s back up a bit and set the scene.\nJesus goes public at a wedding, with that turning-water-into-wine phenomenon—because His mama told Him to. This moment makes me love Him so much, and her too. (I think of her as a not-gonna-take-no-for-an-answer kind of woman.) The miracle was the first public sign of Jesus’ deity. A few folks caught on to Him that day, specifically His disciples (John 2:1-11).\nJesus goes on to cleanse the temple, for church was never intended to be a money-making machine. He sure wasn’t casual about that fact. He started teaching in secret, and then in public, to anyone who asked. Jesus told Nicodemus He didn’t come to condemn, but to save (John 3:16-18). He waited for the Samaritan woman at the well, telling her she had not one hubby, but five—not that it would keep her from the Kingdom. Hardly! She would become one of the first evangelists (John 4:28-29).\nThat’s His way. Jesus offers gifts freely, to the least “deserving” of society. He sought out the overlooked, the abandoned, the shunned, and the outcast. He came for them (Mark 2:17). In return, they lept to Him like a moth to a flame. Crowds swelled, pleading for His healing touch (Mark 2:1-4). Even when they didn’t ask, He’d ask them, “Do you want to get well?” And after lying on a mat for decades, that man at the pool stood right up and walked (John 5:5-15).\nCrowds absorbed every word. They sat for hours in the hot sun to feast on His teaching. One day before Passover, five thousand assembled. Knowing their hunger, He asked for a boy’s lunch—five barley loaves and two fish. He broke the bread, blessed it, and multiplied it. In God-like fashion the thousands were given enough to eat their fill with twelve full baskets left over (Matthew 14:13-21). This was a foreshadowing of God’s lavish provision, offering exceedingly and abundantly above what we ask or think (Ephesians 3:20).\nWhat I love about God is that He begins with the natural and He fulfills with the supernatural. Jesus fed them on a mountain, with literal bread in their bellies, because He knew He’d need to reveal a different kind of bread the next day. This spiritual bread, the bread of God, would also be broken on a mountain, blessed and multiplied, for all who believe. Finally Jesus broke the news as if He could not hold back any longer:\n“I am the bread of life. No one who comes to me will ever be hungry, and no one who believe in Me will ever be thirsty again…I assure you: ANYONE who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life.”\n-John 6:35 (emphasis mine)\nI can only imagine the earnestness in His eyes, breath strained with the weight of these words. His physical body, our bread, would be beaten, stripped, whipped, speared, chained, and broken, so we could partake and never be hungry again.\nThe offering of Jesus would be blessed by the Father and multiplied for ALL who believe. I will never fathom this gift—not in my wildest dreams. But we don’t have to understand; we have only to receive.\n\n\n",

Yet I’m still strangely drawn to watching survival reality shows on TV. That people would choose to endure extreme, potentially fatal, conditions greatly entertains me from the comfort of my couch and extra-large bowl of popcorn. Watching these shows from a safe distance on my cushy perch, I’m reminded of just how vulnerable we humans truly are.\nThe priorities for survival, regardless of setting, include: finding a clean water source, fashioning some form of shelter, locating food, and building a fire. How fitting then, that our Savior, Jesus Christ, proclaims that He is Life (Colossians 3:4), and He is everything essential for life. He is the Living Water (John 4:10) and the Bread of Life (John 6:35). He is our nourishment (John 15:5) and our shelter (Psalm 91). The One who created us also sustains us, giving us everything we need to survive and even thrive here on earth (2 Peter 1:3-4).\nToday we read about another necessity: light. And once again, Jesus does more than provide light for us. Scripture tells us that He Himself is light:\n“I am the light of world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”\n-John 8:12\nHours of watching survival TV shows have taught me that those first precious hours “on the island,” so to speak, are spent using whatever means necessary to start fire. Once burning steadily, the fire provides warmth and a means of cooking food, protection from dangerous enemies, and yes, light. But bringing physical sight into the darkness isn’t all that light gives us. Our need for illumination goes so much deeper. \nLike the man born without sight in John chapter 9, we are spiritually blind, powerless to overcome the darkness. But when Jesus comes near and turns our hearts toward Him, we are given a new kind of sight (2 Corinthians 3:16). In Christ’s presence, we are able to see the world as it truly is. We also begin to see people—all people—as made in the image of God, full of dignity and worth. By His Spirit, the Savior opens our eyes to eternal things, teaching us to walk by faith, not by physical sight (2 Corinthians 4:18, 5:7).\nYou and I aren’t stranded on a desert island today (at least I hope not!), but we are desperate for light all the same. Only the light of Jesus can give us sight, revealing the depth of our sin and the vastness of His grace. Only the light of Jesus cannot be overcome by the darkness (John 1:5).\nFather, You are good, and Your provision is perfect. Draw us near to Jesus, the Light of the world, for warmth, for healing, and for life. Amen.\n\n",

Why did people throw around “sons of Abraham” like it gave them some kind of special position of privilege? It seems like you couldn’t turn around in the New Testament without stepping on a son of Abraham (Luke 13:6; 19:9).\nAbraham was important because he was the initial beneficiary of God’s covenant oath. Remember when God promised him offspring as numerous as the stars in the sky (Genesis 22:17)? By the time Jesus walked the earth, Abraham’s starry offspring were everywhere, clamoring for their rightful due as inheritors of the covenant.\nAs soon as my husband woke up this morning I nudged him, “Hey honey, where’s that verse in Matthew where Jesus says something like, ‘If I had a nickel for every son of Abraham…’?” He rolled over, opened his eyes, and grinned, “Oh, I don’t reckon Jesus mentions nickels in the New Testament.”\nAfter coffee and some hunting, we found it. It turns out I was mistaken—the quote was from John the Baptist. In Matthew 3, he says, “And don’t presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones! Even now the ax is ready to strike the root of the trees! Therefore, every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire” (Matthew 3:9-10).\nWhile John the Baptist doesn’t mention nickels here, he’s essentially saying they’ve placed too much importance on being a son of Abraham and missed the bigger picture. In fighting over cotton candy, they were missing the whole circus.\n“Jesus said to them, ‘I assure you: Before Abraham was, I am.’”\n-John 8:58\nJesus references Abraham because He is declaring not only His divinity, but His supreme authority and redemptive purpose. He is announcing His true self and declaring that He is greater than Abraham. Indeed, Christ was “before” Abraham in two profound ways.\nFirst, as Creator, Christ is the firstborn over all creation (Colossians 1:15), and without Him nothing would have been made (John 1:3). As Creator, He has authority over everything. And as His creation, we ought to respond to Him with every obedience. He has made us for Himself (Isaiah 43:7), and therefore, we cannot live unto ourselves. We owe Him our whole lives—we owe Him everything.\nSecond, Christ is before Abraham because He is the Messiah. He was anointed to save us from our sins (Isaiah 61:1). This is the same gospel truth that overjoyed father Abraham—“he saw it and rejoiced” (John 8:56). Even now, Christ performs His role as perfect mediator before God’s throne, on our behalf (Hebrews 8:6).\nBelieving that Christ is the Messiah runs counter to our inclination to try to save ourselves. We endeavor to invent our own system of salvation, based upon our own accomplishments and problem-solving skills. We’d like to take at least a little credit, but we can’t: Christ is the only Savior. He alone is the appointed One. No man comes to the Father, but by Him (John 14:6).\nChrist is greater than Abraham both because He is before him, and because He is the very Hope in which Abraham put his faith. He has proclaimed Himself to us, saying, “I Am!” that we might have fellowship in Him, that our joy may be complete (I John 1:3-4). Thanks be to God.\n\n",

I know it’s silly, but it’s true. Growing up, I watched shows like The Price Is Right, Family Feud, or Wheel of Fortune. The shows’ potential prizes were typically hidden behind closed doors. And so there I’d sit, enthralled, wondering at what might be waiting for the contestants just behind Door Number One: a new stove, a new car… a free trip to the Bahamas?!\nLife outside of a game show offers lots of doors, too, though the prospects of what might lie beyond them aren’t always a safe bet. There are countless doors before us, offering—even promising—something shiny, something new, something better than what we presently have. \nIf our hope is tethered to what this world can offer, we too easily fall for its lies promising “more.” Especially when life feels too difficult, it’s tempting to look for some version of that island escape. But what Jesus offers is something amazing, a better door. He offers Himself. \nJesus said: \n“I assure you: I am the door of the sheep. . . I am the door.\nIf anyone enters by Me, he will be saved and will come in and go out and find pasture.”\n-John 10:7,9\nJesus Christ is the door through which all who believe must enter. He is the Shepherd who offers abundant life to His sheep. “A thief comes to steal and kill and destroy,” Jesus said. “I have come so that they may have life and have it in abundance” (John 10:10). \nWhat is this abundant life found in Jesus? It is a life of peace with God (Romans 5:1). It is access to God by faith—a prize we don’t have to work for to get or make an educated guess to keep (Ephesians 2:8). When we enter through the Door who is Jesus Christ, we can stand confident, secure, and without shame (Ephesians 3:12, Hebrews 4:16). We are sheep, but we don’t have to be sheepish with our heavenly Father. We have access to eternal hope and joy in the presence of God, through Jesus the Son.  \nNot only is Jesus the door through which we enter, He is the very cornerstone of our faith. Peter said to the high priests in Jerusalem, “This Jesus is the stone rejected by you builders, which has become the cornerstone. There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to people, and we must be saved by it” (Acts 4:11-12, emphasis mine). Even the high priests must enter God’s presence through the Door—through Christ!\nThis life will have trials, this we know. What’s hidden behind the doors we encounter will not always be what we hoped. But there is one Door we can always trust, one Door that leads to the abundant life we long for. In Jesus Christ alone “we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God.” In Him we have a hope that will not disappoint! Because of Jesus, “God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us” (Romans 5:1-5). \nUnmerited forgiveness, eternal peace, and lavish love—that is the abundant life we have when we enter through the Door of the Sheep. \nThis is the door I want to go through. No other door compares.\n\nTrillia Newbell is the author of Fear and Faith: Finding the Peace Your Heart Craves (2015) and United: Captured by God’s Vision for Diversity (2014).

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Debbie Eaton\n\nText: John 10:11-18, Jeremiah 10:20-21, Psalm 23:1-6\nThis is part of a 10-day series on the person of Christ in the 2016 Lent study.\nAfter ten long years of infertility, I learned I was pregnant with our son.\nThe day I found out, I began praying for him, talking to him, and reading to him while he was in my womb. He was born on a beautiful May morning, and I was over-the-moon excited to see him. What I did not expect was the undeniable awe I would experience that first time when the sound of my voice turned his head and our eyes locked. He knew my voice. \nAs we got to know each other, I learned his voice too—his cries for hunger and pain, discomfort and contentment. I could then interact with him intentionally, attending to each cry and coo. My heart was flooded with love, and I knew without a doubt that I would lay down my life for this precious bundle of joy if I had to.\nGod knew this parental love firsthand with Jesus (Matthew 3:17). He also gave us a tangible picture of what love, care, guidance, and protection look like in the image of a Shepherd taking care of His flock.\n“I am the good shepherd, I know My own sheep, and they know Me, as the Father knows Me, and I know the Father.”\n-John 10:14-15\nThis verse paints a beautiful image of the relational significance between the Father and the Son, and between the Shepherd and His flock. It is a relationship of complete dependence, one begun by relying upon the sound of the Shepherd’s voice. A sheep need only follow His voice and stay in His presence to be in a place that’s safe where it can thrive. \nIt is the same with us and Jesus.\nUnfortunately, the voices of everyday life compete for our attention and can easily drown out the sound of the Good Shepherd’s voice. The voices of false shepherds speak in smooth, deceitful tones for self-gain and self-promotion. They care little about the safety and wellbeing of their sheep. When danger comes, these heartless shepherds will flee, protecting and preserving themselves over their sheep. And should one of their flock become sick or somehow undesirable, it will be cast out or altogether forgotten (John 10:12-13). Their flock will lose their way (Jeremiah 10:21).\nWhen we trust and follow any other voice but the Good Shepherd’s, we’re easily led astray to be left utterly alone, rejected and dejected. But do not be discouraged: even if you’ve been taken advantage of in the past by deceitful shepherds, there is good news because of Jesus. \nJesus is the long-awaited, true Good Shepherd, who does not lose sight of His sheep (Ezekiel 34). He knows the heart and condition of each one in His flock. He searches for them and inspects them, just to make sure there is no disease within them (Psalm 139:23-24).\nHe heals the sick, injured, and brokenhearted and binds up their wounds (Psalm 147:3). He protects them against danger, goes after those who wander away, and pursues those who are lost (Matthew 18:12-14). Above all, the Good Shepherd laid down His life for His flock, once and forever, to rescue them from the jaws of deceit and captivity, so that not even one would perish (John 10:11, 3:16). He did that for me, for you.\nThis is our Jesus, the Good Shepherd of our souls. He hears each beat and cry of our hearts, and He knows exactly what we need. \nDo you know His voice?\nI don’t know what you’re facing right now, but the Good Shepherd knows. His voice is gentle, and soothing, leading each of one us to quiet waters where He waits to revive us. He protects, comforts us, and guides us along the right path—even when we go through the darkest of valleys. His goodness and faithful love pursue us each and every day of our lives (Psalm 23).\n“My sheep hear My voice, I know them, and they follow Me.”\n-John 10:27\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nText: John 11:1-44, 1 Corinthians 15:50-57\nThis is part of a 10-day series on the person of Christ in the 2016 Lent study.\nIt never crossed my mind that I’d never been behind the wheel of the Jeep.\nI’d always had Ken, as I called him, the most reliable of brothers who’d plop into the driver’s seat with directions, a new playlist, and extra ChapStick®. “Kait,” as he called me, “up for milkshakes on the way home?” Regardless of our destination, milkshakes were always on the itinerary.\nWe’d sit in a vacant parking lot sipping cookie dough shakes and cracking inside jokes long into the night, blurring the lines between siblings and best friends. Loud music would shake the seats splattered with paint, an indication of my brother’s latest business venture. He was 20 years old and an entrepreneur, known for pausing my favorite song to write down an idea on a legal pad found in his glove box.\nUpon returning to our childhood home where our parents were fast asleep, we’d gently close the Jeep doors and tiptoe in to keep the dog from barking. At the top of the stairs, he would turn to me and whisper, “Thanks for going!”\nBut one day, tragedy slammed the door on our adventures, replacing them with silence. Ken, my ice cream-slurping, idea-birthing, inside-joking best friend of a brother was gone. I was a passenger without a driver to call me “Kait,” left with nothing but grief and an empty gold Jeep.\nI don’t know if Lazarus had nicknames for Mary and Martha or what inside jokes made them giggle, but I bet they felt the same stilled shock of losing their childhood co-keeper. Maybe they’d dreamed about becoming aunts and uncles and promised to keep secrets from mom and dad forever. But sickness had overcome their sweet brother, the tomb slicing their family tree. It wasn’t fair.\nFour days later, Jesus arrived (John 11:17). \nDays after losing my own brother, the Jeep’s headlights appeared in the driveway. The stranger at the wheel had driven it back home to us. I remember watching his chapped lips murmur his condolences. My brother’s Jeep was here but he was not, and so its presence meant something very different now; never again would the parked car in the driveway signify a full house.\nMartha shared in my sisterly sorrow as she greeted Jesus that day. “Lord, if You had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died” (John 11:21).\nJesus answered her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in Me, even if he dies, will live. Everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die—ever. Do you believe this?” (John 11:25-26).\n“Yes, Lord,” she told Him, “I believe You are the Messiah, the Son of God, who comes into the world” (John 11:27).\nMy grieving heart admires Martha’s expressed faith, but my sisterly intuition knows she’s still staring into a sibling-shaped void.\nSoon after hearing of Jesus’ arrival, Mary expressed the same grief: “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died!” And this time, as Jesus asked where Lazarus was buried, He began to weep.\nTo Martha, Jesus establishes that He is God.\nTo Mary, Jesus establishes that He is human. \nHe could have asserted His power to Martha and bee-lined to the miracle, but He didn’t. He intentionally walked through the weeping. He entered into the sorrow and the heartbrokenness for His glory and for our gain (John 11:4,14-15).\nJesus enters the grief of humanity to show us the only way out—Himself.\nWhen I moved to a new city, the gold Jeep came with me. The signature paint splatters became permanent and the scribbled legal pads never moved. Now I sit in the driver’s seat. I fit my hands into the grooves left by my brother’s grip, and sink into the memories as I place my foot on the gas.\nNow I realize that Jesus does the same thing: He places Himself in our pain, so that we, His grieving sisters, might grieve no more (Romans 8:17). He gave up His life to bookend our sorrow between who He is and why He came—to rescue our souls and make us adopted kin of the Resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:51-52).\nHe is the resurrection and the life.\nHe came to swallow up death in victory.\nHe died and rose again so that we might live.\nThanks be to God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Missy Fuller\n\nText: John 13:31-14:7, Acts 17:22-31, Psalm 1:1-6\nThis is part of a 10-day series on the person of Christ in the 2016 Lent study.\nI’m notorious for going the wrong way on one-way streets—usually when I’m trying to find free parking. It’s as if finding a close, free place to park trumps all other rules of the road. I do whatever I can to find that perfect spot, fully ignoring the large “One Way” and “Wrong Way” street signs meant to caution me. It seems that when free parking is at stake, the rules fly out my car window. I intend to get there my way, regardless of the consequences.\nI hate to admit it, but far too often I have the same attitude in my spiritual life, believing my way is best. But Scripture tells us Jesus is the only way to the Father. Chasing after our salvation in any way apart from Christ, is the wrong way.\n“I am the way and the truth and the life.\nNo one comes to the Father except through me.”\n-John 14:6\nThe Bible couldn’t say it any plainer, but I’m still prone to try and negotiate my own salvation.\nI put my hope in all kinds of things to save me, believing they’ll somehow grant me abundant life. And when the Lord graciously steps in to remind me that He is the only way to salvation, I can become fearful. How can it really be so simple? Surely there’s something more.\nYes, I believe Christ is the only way, but then I turn around and start doing all these things to help ‘seal the deal’ of eternity for me. I want to fully surrender to Jesus, because deep down I know that only He can save. But far too often I live like I believe otherwise—as if I could add to His perfect sacrifice!\nLike trying to find the ultimate parking spot, I try to find my own way to salvation. I’m afraid that if I follow Jesus with all my heart and all my soul and all my mind (Matthew 22:37)—instead of following myself—I might miss something.\nI think Peter and Thomas had similar fears. At the Last Supper, both disciples had questions as Jesus explained He is the only way to the Father. Peter didn’t understand why he couldn’t go with Jesus right then and there (John 13:36). He thought he’d miss salvation if it didn’t happen on his timeline. Thomas didn’t have all the information he thought he needed to follow Jesus (John 14:5). He wanted to walk by sight instead of faith.\nIn Acts 17, we read about the “extremely religious” people of Athens, who worshiped no shortage of idols and false gods. They worshiped countless things, yet were ignorant of what they were actually worshiping. They even had an altar for an “unknown god”—just in case they missed paying homage to something that could save (Acts 17:22-31).\nI have more in common with the people of Athens than I’d like to believe. I’m ignorant of the of all the idols I worship.\nMy appearance.\nMy reputation.\nMy success.\nMy accomplishments.\nMy relationships…\nThe list goes on and on, but the result is still the same: none of these idols can save.\nOnly Jesus. What a sweet relief!\nJesus is the only way. He’s our only hope! When we try to navigate our own way to salvation, we become confused. Like Peter and Thomas, we worry we’ve missed something. Like the people of Athens, we become distracted by the countless gods we worship.\nBut the truth is this: when we have Jesus, we have all we’ll ever need. \nThanks be to God that Jesus is the only way to Him, to truth, and to life. May we learn to stand firm in this Truth, clinging only to Him for life (Psalm 1:1-6).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebekah Lyons\n\nText: John 15:1-10, Psalm 80:1-19\nThis is part of a 10-day series on the person of Christ in the 2016 Lent study.\nLast September, one lazy afternoon during Shabbat, I strolled along a path through a biblical garden in Israel. We’d been there for a week, staying at that gorgeous kibbutz overlooking the Emmaus road, inspired by the garden and the community that lived and worked there.\nAs I walked alone, the wind picked up from the east around 1:00 pm, fast and furious. I stopped in my tracks, as if Jesus were about to stroll around the bend, white robe and hair flowing, to offer a bear hug. A girl can dream, yes? Minutes later my eyes landed on a branch dangling in front of me; I was standing beneath a grape arbor canopied with a roof of vines overhead. \nI looked more closely and noticed a tiny leaf, torn almost in two. At the bottom of the leaf a green vine had wrapped itself in a ball around the torn part, binding the tear and holding the leaf close against itself. I got choked up. For years I suffered with panic disorder while living in New York City, and I’d always describe myself as “untethered,” flailing and fleeting like that torn leaf.\nI ran to gather the rest of my group, to show them this gift of analogy. Our guide, Arie, joined us with bright eyes and zeal, eager for any teachable moment. He shared that the nature of the vine when it touches something, is to begin wrapping itself around it, making them one.\nThat year, I’d been reading Andrew Murray’s Abiding in Christ, excavating my soul and learning how this vine-and-branch thing worked. My encounter with the little vine that day reminded me of this passage from the book:\nWandering one: As it was Jesus who drew you when He said, “Come,” so it is Jesus who keeps you when He says, “Abide.” The grace to come and the grace to abide are alike from Him alone. . . The chord of love that drew you near. . . . holds you fast and binds you to Himself.\nMy entire life I thought my closeness with Jesus was dependent upon me. But Jesus’ love draws us in for one thing: to come into His presence and His rest. That’s it. How many of us could use a little soul rest? And when we do come, the Vine takes the reins from there. He pulls us close and tethers us to Himself. \nThe greatness doesn’t stop there. This tethering becomes provision, meaning all the nutrients of heaven are offered to us right now, to renew us and bring us back to life. Jesus gives us everything we need in life to push back the darkness (2 Peter 1:3). He gently binds us to Himself. He brings forth fruit, grown from the life He’s given us, to then bring nourishment to the world. Jesus does it all. Fruit never comes from our own making—it grows to the measure we let Him grow it in us (John 15:5). \nWhat a beautiful relief! The Old Covenant was about what we bring to Him: our annual offering, our covering of sin to become restored with God. But the New Covenant is all about what Jesus brings to us. \nHis offering. His blood to cover our sin. His righteousness credited to us, declaring us right with God. May we stop striving today and rest in the grip of the Vine’s loving-kindness.\nRebekah Lyons is the author of Freefall to Fly: A Breathtaking Journey Toward a Life of Meaning.

We can pretty much say whatever we want, to whomever we want, whenever we want. And with the power of social media, we have a tremendous amount of control over the image we portray of ourselves.\nNot long ago, a group of models and actresses began posting pictures of themselves without makeup, as a protest against the impossible standards of physical beauty their industries demanded of them. Their point was that without Photoshop, makeup, and lighting, they looked just like the rest of us. \nOur beauty should be found in what we really are—not some doctored-up, false image. Our images should reveal our true selves.\nToday’s Scripture passage talks about the true image of Christ. The focus, however, is not on His physical appearance, but on His divine essence. When Paul says that Jesus Christ is the “image of the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15) and the “exact imprint of His nature” (Hebrews 1:3), he is making the profoundly startling claim that Jesus Christ is God.\nIt’s a claim not everyone accepts. The religious leaders of Jesus’ time cried blasphemy at such claims (John 10:31-39), so it’s not surprising that blasphemy became the central charge levied against Jesus leading to His crucifixion (Luke 22:66-71). The problem is that the religious leaders were both right and wrong about Jesus. They were right in concluding that when Jesus said, “before Abraham was I am” (John 8:58), He was claiming to be God. But they were wrong when they judged His claim to be false.\nWhat the Bible teaches—and what the church has upheld throughout history—is that God and man can only be reconciled through a man who is God. Only someone who could perfectly represent both the image of God and the image of man could forge the peace that is needed between the two.\nJesus demonstrated the perfect holiness of God as God.\nHe also represented the perfect righteousness required of man as a man.\nJesus both offered and became the perfect sacrifice for the world’s sin as the God-man, making Him the only One who could accomplish the perfect reconciliation of all things.\nAll of Jesus’s “I AM” statements come together to give the world the image of who He truly is—the Son of God and the Savior of sinners. “For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him, and through Him to reconcile everything to Himself by making peace through the blood of His cross” (Colossians 1:19-20). \nThanks be to God.\n\n \nPastor Nate Shurden is one of the local pastors who serves She Reads Truth & He Reads Truth by providing theological oversight and pastoral counsel.

Rather than offer personal, written responses to each day’s Scripture reading, we’ve asked our friend, Pastor Russ Ramsey, to provide a real-time summary of the week’s events. Our prayer is that this more descriptive approach will usher you into the narrative and allow space for you to fully engage the beauty and ache of Holy Week. \nTake this week slowly and reverently. It is a somber time, but let us never forget: Sunday is coming.\n___\nThe ride Jesus took into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday was a moment vital to our salvation.\nWhen Jesus rode into Jerusalem, perched up on that colt on the Sunday before His crucifixion, it was the first time since raising Lazarus from the dead that He’d shown His face in the city. The story of Lazarus’ resurrection had circulated, so even those who only heard about it later regarded Jesus as something of a celebrity. Everyone wanted to catch a glimpse of Him. John tells us that because they heard Jesus had raised Lazarus, they went out to meet Him and received Him like a King (John 12:12-18).\nJesus said Lazarus’ death would end in the faith of many and in the “glory of God—that the Son of God may be glorified through it” (John 11:4). But the glory He had in mind was even more magnificent than His triumphal entry into Jerusalem. In fact, Jesus wasn’t referring to the glory the people gave Him at all. Lazarus’ resurrection would steel the resolve of the religious leaders to hand Jesus over to a death He would freely accept—a death He would ultimately conquer (John 11:45-53). That was the glory He meant.\nThis Sunday was the hour of Jerusalem’s visitation. Jesus loved this city. He wept over her because what the people wanted and what they needed were so far from one another (Luke 19:41-44). Jesus knew the full extent of the salvation these people required, and He also knew what it would cost. He knew salvation was unfolding before them in that very moment.\nThe punishment that would bring them peace was about to be laid upon Him (Isaiah 53:6).\nJesus knew the religious leaders would play a role in bringing this punishment to Him because they feared Rome more than they feared God. He knew they would be willing to kill one of their own if it meant preserving the privilege of worship that Caesar had granted (John 11:48-50).\nAnd so it was that He rode on into the city and made His way to the temple while the people of Israel parted like a holy curtain torn, crying, “Hosanna!” which means, “Please, save us now” (Matthew 21:6-9).\nAs Jesus rode along, the people cried out to one another, “Your King is coming!” (Mark 11:10) and they praised His victory over Lazarus’ death (John 12:17-18). But the irony was that He wasn’t coming to claim His crown on account of Lazarus’ death and resurrection. He was coming to claim it on account of His own.\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\nadapted from Behold the King of Glory\n\n",

With that kingly arrival on Sunday, Jesus had made a strong declaration about His authority over all the conventions of man.\nOn Monday He returned for more, this time to declare the failure of His own people to live up to the covenantal mandate God had given them to be a blessing to the world (Matthew 21:12-13).\nMuch of what the Gospels tell us about Monday centers on the theme of Jesus’ authority—both over the created world and in His right to pass judgment upon it. Everything Jesus did He did with authority. \nSo when He woke His disciples Monday saying He wanted go back into Jerusalem to teach in the temple, as risky as it sounded, it wasn’t surprising. But everyone sensed something stirring, as if Jesus had rounded a corner and His end was coming fast. He was a marked man.\nWhen Jesus saw the commotion, commerce, and chaos going on in the temple, He was indignant. The way the Sanhedrin led Israel was not how God’s people were supposed to be led. The temple was a sacred space, and worship was a holy matter. The propriety and dignity of approaching the presence of God had found an advocate in this visiting rabbi. And so, on the Monday before His crucifixion, Jesus went into the temple and overturned the money changers’ tables (Mark 11:15-19).\nThis was not the first time Jesus had done this. He had cleared the temple like this once earlier, back before anyone knew His name. Then He had warned the merchants to remove the money-changers’ tables and stop making His Father’s house into a den of thieves (John 2:13-17).\nIf the first time Jesus cleared the temple served as a warning; this time it served as a judgment. This was not an eruption of sudden anger. Jesus saw nothing on that Monday He hadn’t seen many other times. He had even stood in this very place as recently as the day before, so nothing He saw came as a surprise. Jesus simply did what He planned to do.\nJesus’ provocative actions in overturning the money changers’ tables spoke to His deep concern for the way God’s people had traded the work of loving God for a religion of economy. And ever since, He remains involved in the provocative work of overturning idolatrous hearts, calling them back to the dignity and sanctity for which they were intended.\n\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\nadapted from Behold the King of Glory\n",

Our prayer is that this more descriptive approach will usher you into the narrative and allow space for you to fully engage the beauty and ache of Holy Week.\nTake this week slowly and reverently. It is a somber time, but let us never forget: Sunday is coming.\n___\nThe Tuesday of Holy Week was filled with drama.\nIf Monday’s arrival in the temple was marked by Jesus’ living parable of cleansing God’s house, Tuesday’s entrance was marked by a direct, verbal confrontation from the religious leadership, the Sanhedrin. They demanded to know who gave Jesus the right to behave as He has in their temple (Mark 11:27-33).\nThis entire confrontation was an attempt to put Jesus in His place by forcing Him to yield to the Sanhedrin’s authority. But when they tried, they failed. Jesus asked smarter questions and gave clearer answers than they did (Matthew 21:23-27). When they tried to question His motives, He exposed their hearts. When they attempted to intimidate Him by coming to Him in numbers, He never showed the slightest sign of backing down. They tried to discredit His ministry, but there were people walking around in the temple who, only days earlier, had been blind and lame (Matthew 21:14).\nJesus had literally turned the tables on the Sanhedrin the day before (Matthew 21:12), but today He had done it again—only this time with further-reaching implications. When they demanded that He submit to their authority, He exposed them as liars. If they had no integrity, they held no real authority.\nThis forced the religious leaders’ hand. If they wanted to contain Jesus’ influence among the people, they would have to rely on more than warnings and bravado. They would have to remove Him—because it was clear that He would not yield.\nAfter Jesus ended the confrontation on Tuesday by refusing to regard these leaders as having any authority over Him, He elected to spend the rest of the day right there in the temple—His Father’s house—so that He might teach the people the Word of God (Matthew 21:28-23:39). Consider for a moment the strength and resolve that standing His ground would have required.\nBut Tuesday afternoon would be the last time Jesus would publicly teach in the temple as a free man. His words on that day would be His closing argument—His manifesto.\nWhen Jesus left the temple that Tuesday, the chief priests and the scribes sought how to arrest Him by stealth and kill Him (Mark 14:1). They knew they couldn’t take His life from Him solely on the strength of the charges they meant to bring—not if He defended Himself, anyway.\nBut He would not. Instead, by His silence, He would offer up His life for a world of blasphemers, traitors, and liars who so desperately needed to be opposed and upset. This was what Jesus had come to do.\nAs He left the temple that Tuesday afternoon, He knew it would happen soon.\n\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\nadapted from Behold the King of Glory\n",

It is a somber time, but let us never forget: Sunday is coming.\n___\nOn the Wednesday before His death, Jesus was still. Though Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday of Holy Week were filled with harrowing experiences that seemed to be drawing Him ever nearer to His death, on Wednesday Jesus stayed out of the public eye.\nOn this day, Jesus and His disciples had gone to the home of a man in Bethany known as Simon the leper (Matthew 26:6). Simon belonged to a growing part of the population known not for their accomplishments, but for what was wrong with them. It was a difficult life, but it must also have been strangely liberating since the first thing people learned about Simon was his broken past. Simon lived among the few who did not have to pretend to be what they were not. He was Simon, the leper. People could choose his company or reject it, but that was who he was.\nIn Simon’s home, during their meal together, Mary of Bethany, Lazarus’ sister, came to Jesus with an alabaster flask of perfume (Mark 14:3). She had been saving this perfume, worth a year’s wages, to perform this very act.\nShe began to pour the perfume on Jesus’ head and feet, which required breaking open its container. Like popping the cork on a $20,000 bottle of champagne, Mary intentionally and deliberately offered Jesus everything she had. By giving Him her most valuable possession, Mary was expressing that she knew what Jesus was about to give of Himself was for her. \nThe disciples reacted like many men often do. They considered the value of her perfume and regarded her actions as though she might as well have been burning a year’s wages in a bread oven. But they dressed their indignation up in the noble auspices of concern for the poor: Think of the poor people who could have benefited from the sale of this perfume (Mark 14:4-5).\nBut this was not how her actions hit Jesus. He came to her aid. What Mary is doing is beautiful, He said to them (Mark 14:6).\nAppreciate the doctrinal principle here. The perfume could have been sold for a year’s wages, but what is perfume for? Is it merely a commodity Mary should have held on to in the event that she needed to cash it in? Is this how God would expect her to regard this valuable resource?\nApparently not. Perfume is meant to be poured out, released into the air until it is gone, in order to fill the room with its beautiful and startling aroma. So Mary breaks open the jar and the scent electrifies the senses of everyone present, and Jesus says it is beautiful.\nEverything in creation testifies to a Creator who delights in beauty for beauty’s sake. So many things that are beautiful didn’t need to be. And it was God who elected to make them that way. He opted to make autumn a season saturated with bold, changing color. He didn’t have to make the setting sun the spectacle that it is. But He did. Why?\nOne reason must be because beauty pleases Him. And another may simply be to arrest people by their senses when they’re otherwise just plodding along, heads down, living within the economy of pragmatism.\nWhat Mary did that day was beautiful and Jesus wanted everyone to know it. She was preparing Him for burial. There was honor and kindness in her gesture. He returned the honor by saying history would never forget her act of beauty (Mark 14:8-9). And we haven’t.\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\nadapted from Behold the King of Glory\n",

Our prayer is that this more descriptive approach will usher you into the narrative and allow space for you to fully engage the beauty and ache of Holy Week.\nTake this week slowly and reverently. It is a somber time, but let us never forget: Sunday is coming.\n___\nThe Thursday prior to Jesus’ crucifixion fills many pages in Scripture.\nIt began with John and Peter securing the upper room (Matthew 26:17-19). There in that room, Jesus would wash His disciples’ feet, explaining He had come to make them clean (John 13:1-20). As they began to eat, Jesus told them that one of them was about to betray Him. Each disciple wondered if He meant them. Meanwhile, Jesus discreetly dispatched Judas to do what he intended (John 13:21-30).\nDuring this last supper, Jesus set apart the Passover bread and cup and reassigned—or better, perfected—their meaning. The bread is His Body. The cup is His blood. This meal would no longer primarily remind them of how God delivered their forefathers from the external tyranny of Pharaoh. Now it would remind them of how Christ delivered them from the internal tyranny of their own guilt and sin against God (Luke 22:14-23).\nThen Jesus prayed for them, His friends, and for those who would come to know Him through their testimony. He prayed that His Father would make them one (John 17). After praying, Jesus rose to His feet and asked His disciples to stand with Him to sing a doxology over their suspended, unfinished Passover meal. Jesus led them in the traditional Passover song, Psalm 118, about how the stone the builders rejected had become the cornerstone, and how the steadfast love of the Lord endures forever.\nTo pause and lead His disciples in a song like this, at this particular moment, shows the strength of Jesus’ resolve to face His impending arrest and crucifixion. The Gospel accounts tell us that He started that Last Supper overwhelmed with sorrow, and that later in Gethsemane His sweat became like drops of blood (John 13:21, Luke 22:44). In the middle of that tension, Jesus sang of the faithfulness of God.\nThink about that for a moment: one of the things Jesus did on the night He was betrayed was sing (Matthew 26:30).\nWhen they finished singing, Jesus led His disciples out to the Mount of Olives, to one of their regular meeting places—the Garden of Gethsemane (Mark 14:26-32). But Jesus didn’t go there only to pray. He also went there to wait. Soon a line of torches snaked their way toward Him through the darkness (Mark 14:42-46). This was what He had been waiting for.\n\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\nadapted from Behold the King of Glory\n",

It is a somber time, but let us never forget: Sunday is coming.\n___\nGood Friday, the Friday of Holy Week, puts to us this question once again: Who do you say Jesus is?\nLate Thursday night in Gethsemane, Jesus was arrested—betrayed by one of His own disciples and abandoned by His others. The Chief Priests and the Sanhedrin called for secret trials in the dead of night, and the verdict was handed down that Jesus would be crucified (Mark 14:53-65). This was an official order the Roman Prefect, Pontius Pilate, would have to give. And reluctantly, on Friday morning, he did (Mark 15:1-15).\nAfter a severe beating, Jesus was nailed to a cross where He would remain for six hours until dead (Matthew 27:27-44).\nHe was crucified between two thieves. As He hung there, weak, bloody, and exposed, people from the crowd taunted and mocked Him—scoffing that if He really was the Son of God, then why didn’t He come down from the Cross (Matthew 27:40)? They could not begin to fathom the irony of their logic. That cross was the reason the Son of God had come, and His place as our atoning sacrifice was one only He could occupy. It was Jesus’ presence on the cross, not His ability to come down from it, that would prove His divinity. They knew not what they did.\nOne of the thieves started in with contemptuous words of his own, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself. Save us!” But the gravity of the scene settled on the other thief as he watched Jesus take the brutality of His captors to God in the form of a prayer for mercy. The thief also watched Jesus give His own grieving mother to His treasured friend. Seeing the grace by which Jesus received this death, the second thief broke into sobs, saying to Him, “Forgive me. I am here for the wrongs I have done, but You have done nothing. Please, remember me when You pass from this place into Your waiting kingdom” (Luke 23:39-43, my paraphrase).\nAt around 3:00pm, Jesus died (Luke 23:44-46).\nNever before or since has more been lost and gained at the same time as at Jesus’ crucifixion. The world gained the atoning sacrifice of Christ. But for many of those present, their hearts broke because the One they believed to be the Savior of the world was dying at the hands of Rome. They couldn’t stop it, and they didn’t yet realize—He was dying for them. Many had put their hope in Jesus, and though He had told them earlier that He would suffer many things and rise three days later (Mark 8:31), how could they possibly have known this was what He meant?\nThe reactions of the condemned men crucified on either side of Jesus and those gathered at the foot of the cross tell the story of every man and woman when it comes to what we make of Christ’s crucifixion. The cross of Jesus confronts us all with the question of the true identity of Jesus Christ. Times of desperation can harden us or soften us, but the question of Easter never goes away: Who do you say that Jesus is?\n\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\nadapted from Behold the King of Glory\n",

It is a somber time, but let us never forget: Sunday is coming.\n___\nThe Saturday following Jesus’ crucifixion might be the most unique and overlooked day in the history of the world. It is the day between Jesus’ death and His resurrection.\nLess is written in the Gospels about this day than any other in the scope of this week known as Holy Week. But what makes it so unique is this: it is the only full day in history where the body of the crucified Son of God lay dead and buried in a grave.\nThe day before, He was crucified. The following day He would rise from the grave. But what happened on Saturday? Though we may not know much about this day, when we look at the few verses the Gospels give us accounting for it, we find it was by no means a forgotten day to the Chief Priests who had handed Jesus over to death.\nDuring His earthly ministry, Jesus said many times that He would die in Jerusalem at the hands of the Chief Priests, but on the third day He would rise again (Matthew 12:40, Mark 8:31, 9:31, 10:34). Of course, the Chief Priests scoffed at this. But they didn’t forget it. On the day between Good Friday and Easter Sunday, Jesus’ prediction preoccupied their thoughts in such a way that they couldn’t leave it alone.\nMatthew 27:62-66 tells us the strange story of how the Chief Priests simply could not dismiss the possibility that Jesus might have known something they didn’t. They went to Pilate and explained that while Jesus was clearly an imposter, His disciples might try to steal His body and fake a resurrection. Pilate’s response was laced with poetic foreshadowing when he said, “Here is a guard of soldiers. Make the tomb as secure as you can.” \nPilate’s words reminds me of C.S. Lewis who said, “Really, a young Atheist cannot guard his faith too carefully. Dangers lie in wait for him on every side” (Surprised by Joy).\nThe entire week leading up to the crucifixion was filled with moments in which Jesus’ power, strength, wisdom, and authority challenged many to reconsider what they presumed about Him. He was not easily forgotten. He forced many, including the religious leaders, Pontius Pilate, and His own twelve disciples, to take a close look at what they really believed about who He was.\nThat Saturday, as His body lay wrapped in linen in a grave, there were many around Jerusalem who sat with uneasy questions about whether or not there would be another chapter in Jesus’ story. His uncommon strength, coupled with the supernatural darkness that settled over the land during His crucifixion (Matthew 27:45), set on edge those who wanted Him dead, even after they’d succeeded. A resurrection would only cause people to believe in Him more.\nBut then, shouldn’t a resurrection cause people to believe in Him more?\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\nadapted from Behold the King of Glory\n",

Today we come to the glorious pinnacle of our journey—Easter Sunday! Special thanks to our friend, Pastor Russ Ramsey, for leading us through this week’s text.\n___\nHe is risen!\nEarly on this Sunday morning during Holy Week, some of Jesus’ friends set out to His grave to anoint the body of their friend and teacher. But when they arrived, they were greeted by what one of the Gospel writers calls “a man dressed in lightning.” He told them Jesus was not there, as He said. He had risen (Matthew 28:1-6).\nEvery instance in Scripture where an angel meets with people involves a human response of fear. This encounter was certainly no different. This meeting Easter morning mirrors when the angel appeared to the shepherds outside Bethlehem to tell them that a Savior had been born unto them. To the shepherds, the angel came to announce that Jesus had come to them (Luke 2:8-20). To the women at the tomb, the angel came to tell them He had left them—but that He would appear again to them soon (Matthew 28:7).\nJesus’ resurrection opened a door between the fallen, groaning world into which He was born and the renewal of all things (Romans 8:22). That door was a stone rolled back by the very finger of God from the mouth of a grave outside of Jerusalem (Matthew 28:2).\nJesus Christ, God’s eternal Son, present at creation, came in the flesh to be the mediator between God and man. He lived the life of perfect righteousness that all people have failed to live. He died as a lamb led to the slaughter, offering Himself up as the perfect sacrifice to atone for the sins of the world, once and for all. He rose from the grave defeating death itself (1 Corinthians 15:54). Bearing all authority in heaven and on earth (Matthew 28:18), He lives as the appointed heir of all things (Hebrews 1:2). Jesus rules over every corner of creation, putting every enemy under His feet, while making alive—by His grace through faith—those who were dead in their sins (Romans 6:11).\nIf Jesus has not risen, those who trust in Him are to be pitied because their hope extends no further than their wishful thinking. Their faith is futile, and they remain in their sins (1 Corinthians 15:16-19). But if Jesus has risen, then His disciples are born into a new hope—because just as death entered the world through one man, Adam, now resurrection has done the same through the incarnate Son of God, who has prevailed over the power of the curse (Romans 5:12-17).\nThe last enemy, death itself, has been destroyed (1 Corinthians 15:26).\nNo one took His life from Him. He laid it down (John 10:18). He laid His life down for His flock, His people. And He laid it down only to take it up again. The point of the cross was not to die, but to die and rise again, defeating the prowling wolves of sin and death themselves.\nJesus said, “I have authority to lay my life down, and I have authority to take it up again.” And this is just what He did. Easter says of Jesus, He meant it! He meant to lay down His life for you! And as sure as He has taken it up again, He knows you!\nHe is risen indeed!\nHappy Easter.\n\nwritten by Russ Ramsey\nadapted from Behold the King of Glory\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nAfter His baptism and before the start of His ministry on earth, the incarnate Son of God walked into the wilderness, no food or drink in hand. He fasted forty days and forty nights, Scripture tells us, and then “the tempter approached him” (Matthew 4:3). Hungry and thirsty and holding no tangible thing of value, Jesus was tempted to take hold of power, to test the Father’s love for Him, to make for Himself a feast of bread to satiate His languishing body. When His human weakness was met with temptation, how did He respond? Using the words of Scripture, He turned to the Father. \nInstead of reaching out for what the world would say He needed, Jesus clung to what He couldn’t live without: “He answered, ‘It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God’” (Matthew 4:4). Rather than yielding to the devil’s enticements, Jesus yielded Himself to the Father and glorified Him: “Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him” (v.10). \nOur culture views empty-handedness as the lowliest of conditions. We are trained to find our worth in usefulness and status, and to seek joy in our possessions. On the off chance we look down to find our hands empty, we quickly scoop up something to hold on to—some bit of work or wealth, some duty or distraction to busy our bodies and entertain our minds. But this hands-full gospel is not the message of Jesus. \nLent is a season where we once again remember that our hope and strength are found in nothing but the cross of Christ. By engaging in daily Scripture reading, prayer, confession, and repentance in these weeks leading up to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, we retrain our hearts to embrace the salvation we cannot earn. We came empty-handed when we first gave our lives to Him, and we have nothing of our own as we return to Him now—only what He has freely and graciously given us.\nThis forty-day walk into the wilderness will bring us face to face with the depth of our lack, our human frailty, and our sin. But it will bring us to the cross, where our High Priest, who modeled perfect dependence on the Father, will show us the cost of our forgiveness in the marks on His body, even as He invites us to receive mercy. \nLent is an invitation to put down everything we have picked up in order to take hold of the only One who can truly satisfy our heart’s deepest longings. It is a call to turn back, and experience a season of refreshing for our souls (Acts 3:19). Come with open hands, and freely receive (Isaiah 55).\n\n",

It is a path of preparation and testing, and as we travel, we are invited to set our faces toward the cross. But it is not a road without joy, for Jesus Himself travels with us, inviting us into a deeper relationship with Him and a richer experience of His kingdom. \nIn the book of Jeremiah, the stones are laid for the road to Calvary. Through the prophet the Lord first revealed the mystery of the new covenant. Jeremiah announced to Israel that God was going to do something new in this world, something that would unravel the knots of sin and death and bring us back to our Creator.\nThrough Jeremiah, the Lord promised, “I will forgive their iniquity and never again remember their sin” (Jeremiah 31:34), and it was Jesus who gave these words their fulfillment. Holding up the cup at the Last Supper, He made the connection to the cross clear: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you” (Luke 22:20). \nThe book of Jeremiah recounts the last days of Judah before the destruction of Jerusalem and the sorrow of the Babylonian exile. It is itself a picture of where our sins lead us apart from the grace of God. In this account, we see our own depravity. Though our sins may differ from those of our ancient counterparts, our hearts are just as prone to wander. And it is only when we see the depths of our own sin that we can see the glory of the cross for what it truly is. During Lent, we take time to reflect on Christ’s sacrifice, and we repent of our own sins that made the cross necessary in the first place.\nThere is also much to gain in getting to know Jeremiah, who stands apart as a faithful man among faithless people—persecuted, beaten, and left for dead because he spoke the words God gave him to speak. He suffered for the gospel long before there was a complete and proper gospel message to proclaim. His life is an arrow pointing to Jesus, who was also obedient despite the cost, and who recognized that God-given joy is worth more than anything this world has to offer. \nThis Lenten season, we will follow Jesus to the mount of crucifixion, but we will do so with Jeremiah as our guide and fellow disciple for the journey. “‘Look, the days are coming’—this is the Lord’s declaration—‘when I will fulfill the good promise that I have spoken’” (Jeremiah 33:14). The cross proclaims this truth, and the empty tomb assures us that our hope is not in vain.\n\nAs the content director for She Reads Truth, He Reads Truth, and Kids Read Truth, John Greco has the best job in the world.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nJodi was one of those fortunate people who knew exactly what she wanted to be when she grew up. Her goal was a beautiful one: to be a clinical dietitian who could bring nutritional education to people in impoverished cultures. Have you known someone like that? I love and admire those people, but I’m definitely not one of them. Besides a love of spending time outdoors, I never had a clear vision for my life and was a bit paralyzed throughout college, not knowing what career path to choose or direction to take. The world held seemingly endless possibilities, but this only crippled me in the decision-making process. \nJeremiah’s calling was clearly and specifically communicated to him. Scripture tells us that long before he was even born, God intended to use him as His prophetic instrument. “I chose you before I formed you in the womb,” God declared. “I set you apart before you were born” (Jeremiah 1:5). Commanded to warn the people of Judah against apostasy, Jeremiah received instructions for his calling very early on in life—a clear purpose with detailed words from the Lord for the salvation and flourishing of a specific people. \nEven so, Jeremiah protested, saying, “Oh no, Lord God! Look, I don’t know how to speak since I am only a youth” (v.6). Wouldn’t we react the same way? Imagine how intimidating it must’ve been to be chosen as God’s mouthpiece for the purpose of declaring judgment and punishment on the sins of the nations. Not only was the job description itself daunting, but the guy delivering it was still really young and without much life experience. But God reassured Jeremiah again and again that He would be there to rescue him (vv.7–8, 19). \nAs comforting as God’s reassurance must have been, the call to be His prophet was in no way an easy job for Jeremiah. On the other hand, what a blessing and relief to have God specifically communicate His calling for you at such a young age. Jeremiah knew what it would look like to obey God’s will. Now he just had to walk in it. \nWhat about you? Where do you find comfort in the story of Jeremiah’s calling? \nGod chooses all of our callings. Designing us to carry out a unique purpose at a specific time and place, He equips us with gifts to help bring restoration to the world (Hebrews 13:21). How exciting is that? Even when we shudder in our boots a little, like Jeremiah did, we can rest assured knowing that He who calls is with us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nI work out at a small gym located on the corner of a busy street in Nashville. Joe, the owner, is a former body-builder with a bald head and more muscles than I could grow in a lifetime. Every Monday and Wednesday, he puts us through the standard suffering: jumping jacks, push-ups, lunges, weighted squats, bicep curls, body movements made impossible with the aid of resistance bands. When my sweat turns to tears and I groan and complain and curse, Joe looks at me and shrugs. \n“I’m sorry,” he says, then announces the next set. \nI know an empty apology when I hear it. If Joe were really sorry about my pain, he wouldn’t go on inflicting it—well, unless it were for my good in the long run; I do pay him for the “suffering,” after all. And that’s just the thing. Real apologies aren’t just words—they are words of genuine feeling married to new actions. Apply that on a cosmic, spiritual level, and that’s where we find the Israelites in Jeremiah chapters 4 through 5. The people are unrepentant, unwilling to marry their words with genuine feeling or change. And the Lord, in his mercy, can no longer stand idly by while they sin themselves into destruction. \nCountless times over the course of this passage, I hear God’s heart in the words He uses to try and woo back the people He loves: Return to me. I long to make you My sons. I will not be angry forever. Return, I will heal. Through Jeremiah, the Lord is telling His people that the way they live their lives matters. At one point in this passage, He calls them to “remove the foreskin of [their] hearts” (Jeremiah 4:4). It’s a harsh word picture, no doubt, but one that reminds us that an outward sign like circumcision means nothing if not paired with an inner heart that values holiness, purity, and connection to God. When I verbally acknowledge that I have lied, but keep lying, I am not truly repentant. Real repentance is accompanied by a change in heart and behavior—a desire to turn away from sin and turn back to God.\nJeremiah would foretell what Jesus accomplished on the cross, the prophet’s words fully realized through the actions of the promised Messiah. Thank goodness we have Jesus’s accomplishments, because the truth is, despite our best efforts, we are unfaithful and will continue to fail in our own strength. But “in him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace that he richly poured out on us with all wisdom and understanding” (Ephesians 1:7–8). \nThrough Jeremiah, the Lord called the Israelites to look through the streets of Jerusalem, to search for a single person who acts justly, yet they couldn’t find a single one. On a good day, my life is full of folly, selfishness, and vanity. I’m sure if I had been alive in Jeremiah’s day, I would’ve been as unrepentant as the Israelites, “who made their faces harder than rock, and… refused to return” (Jeremiah 5:3). \nBut there is good news for me, for each one of us: in Christ Jesus, we have been blessed “with every spiritual blessing in the heavens,” and “sealed with the promised Holy Spirit when [we] heard the word of truth, the gospel of [our] salvation… when [we] believed” (Ephesians 1:3,13). This does not change, even when we fail, even when we struggle to match our words to our actions. Jesus, who loves us, is forgiving and does not run out of invitations for us to return to Him. What God is looking to find in us is not perfect faithfulness—only Jesus can be perfectly faithful. What God is looking for in you and in me is a heart that longs to seek Him. By His Spirit, may we turn to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nWe used to own a truck with over 300,000 miles on it. I loved driving it. The leather was cracked and most of the dashboard lights were burned out. But easing it down a country road with all the windows down made me feel like the wind was at my back and things were going just my way. \nThere was one light, however, that wasn’t burned out: the check engine light. I took it to our favorite mechanic and he looked me square in the eye, “Stop driving this vehicle immediately—one wrong bump and the whole chassis is going to collapse off the axle. This truck will fail disastrously, and soon.” Driving home that afternoon, I considered his words: How soon? How ‘disastrous’ are we talking? How big of a bump? He was probably exaggerating—what even is an axle anyway?\nThings can look just fine on the surface, but rumbling beneath, the true worth will eventually reveal itself. In the case of my truck, it was a catastrophic failure waiting to happen. I thought I could depend on that old truck, but it couldn’t stand up in a way that mattered desperately. In the case of Israel, God appointed Jeremiah as an “assayer” to determine what they were made of—and if they would be able to stand up (Jeremiah 6:27). An assayer is a “refiner,” one who tests the composition of minerals and determines their value. The Lord goes so far as to declare they are so stubborn that they “are bronze and iron; all of them are corrupt” (v.28). But no amount of blasting with fire will reveal valuable metals because the people have rejected the word of the Lord (v.17).\nThe culture described in these chapters is a startling reminder of my own: “they have grown powerful and rich… fat and sleek… [and] excelled in evil matters… and they have not defended the rights of the needy” (Jeremiah 5:27–28). God is calling us to listen to His words and turn from the enticements of this world. He warns that we will be measured and the truth of our hearts will be revealed. \nWho can stand in the face of such an examination? Even though my friendly truck seemed fine to me, it’s impending disaster could not be hidden from the experienced eye of a mechanic. If we persist in not using our eyes to see or our ears to hear—if we refuse to listen to the Lord, our devastation is sure. Indeed, it is our own sins that withhold the Lord’s bounty from us (Jeremiah 5:25). \nIf you are determined not to listen, you cannot stand up to a close examination. But set your feet in obedience to the Lord and He will change the quality of your heart, and deeper examination will reveal the value of His own shining goodness in you. Today if you hear His voice—in His word, in His creation, through His people—do not harden your heart, but listen and worship (Psalm 95:8).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nIf I had a nickel for every time my two daughters had conflict. The offense could be teasing, hitting, not sharing, or a million other things. After talking privately with each of them, I would bring the girls back together, stand them face-to-face and instruct the offender to say, “I’m sorry. It was wrong for me to __.” Occasionally, I would even ask them to hold hands, which caused them to roll their eyes at this admittedly awkward parenting strategy. \nMy goal was not for them to robotically repeat words or to just go through the motions to avoid punishment. As they practiced the external act of reuniting and verbally confessing their sin, my hope was that an inner posture of repentance would grow and that reconciliation would follow. My methods seemed external, yet my goal was always to shape their hearts.\nThroughout the Old Testament, we see how God established specific ways for His people to relate to Him and to others. The Ten Commandments set clear parameters for God’s people. First and foremost was the non-negotiable command to avoid all idolatry: to only worship the one true God (Exodus 20:3). In addition to the Ten Commandments, God gave many other instructions detailing how to conduct civil life, participate in temple worship, and offer sacrifices.\nWhat was the point of all these commands? Was God’s goal to create robotic rule-followers? Definitely not! God’s methods may seem external, but He was always fighting for their hearts. God’s goal was reconciliation and intimacy with His people. This is true for us today as well.\n“When I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt,  I did not speak with them or command them concerning burnt offering and sacrifice.  However, I did give them this command: ‘Obey me, and then I will be your God,  and you will be my people. Follow every way I command you so that it may go well with you’” (Jeremiah 7:22–23).\nThe God of all creation was pursuing relationship with His people—not moralistic law keeping. But they stubbornly resisted and forfeited intimacy by chasing false gods from the nations around them. They went through the motions of worshipping God in the temple, but their hearts were distant from Him. They shamelessly broke the Ten Commandments, which were actually God’s gracious blueprint for how to remain faithful, free, and flourishing. \nWe hear Jeremiah’s anguish as he weeps and wails over this wayward nation (Jeremiah 9:10). Over six hundred years later, we hear a similar lament from Jesus who weeps as He grieves over Jerusalem. Jesus ached for those so bent on human effort and religious duty that they could not recognize that Jesus, the Messiah, was in their midst. \nOh, if I had a nickel for every time I disobey God’s commands, for every time I trust in my external actions to validate me before God and others, for every time my heart grows cold and blind to Jesus.\nOh Lord, I confess that I’m the offender. I’m sorry. It is wrong for me to trust in my own efforts and to chase after things that deliver a mere, momentary buzz of satisfaction and security. Thank you for letting me hear that You long for more. You’ve always fought for the hearts of Your people. I’m so grateful You’re eternally, lovingly pursuing mine.\n\nPatti Sauls lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband Scott and daughters, Abby and Ellie, where they serve alongside the people of Christ Presbyterian Church.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nI spend a lot of time in the kitchen. It is my happiest place, but every once in a while my culinary ambitions do not match the contents of my cupboards, and I have to make substitutions. A little of this substituted for a little of that is usually no big deal in the world of spices and splashes, but when it comes to baking (my very favorite thing to do), substitutions can mean utter disaster.\nChemical reactions between ingredients are the key to successful bread, cookies, or just about any delicious baked thing. One of my favorite cake batters is made with a heavy dose of baking soda and, at the last minute, a big splash of vinegar. It bubbles into the oven, where it creates the loveliest, airiest cake you can imagine. \nNatural law governs chemical reactions; they are always the same. Vinegar and baking soda will always bubble up. Living yeast and warm water will do the same. A splash of vinegar will sour milk, and oil and water won’t mix on their own. There are generally no substitutes for these reactions when it comes to baking. Figuratively, this is the underlying principle found in Jeremiah 10–11: There is no substitute for the steadfast, unchanging God. He can only be who He is and do what is in His nature to do.\nThe truth Jeremiah prophesies is always the same: The promise God made is steadfast, unchangeable, and true, because the one who promised it is steadfast, unchangeable, and true. “You will be my people, and I will be your God,” is found through the whole of Scripture: when God makes His covenant with Abram (Genesis 17), when God tells Moses to confront Pharaoh (Exodus 6), during the giving of the law (Leviticus 26), and multiple times here, within the book of Jeremiah. Paul repeats it in 2 Corinthians 6, and it appears in Revelation 21, with a definitive promise for all time: “They will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them and will be their God” (v.3). \nThis is the covenant promise that will never change. I can imagine Jeremiah weeping with desperation as he wrote the beautiful words that testify to the Lord’s sovereignty and promise:\n“He made the earth by his power, established the world by his wisdom, and spread out the heavens by his understanding… he is the one who formed all things.  Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; the LORD of Armies is his name” (Jeremiah 10:12,16).\nThere is no substitute for the Lord of Armies. His reactions to the sins of His people are not separate from His steadfast, unchangeable love. He’d called them to obey Him and follow His commands, which were a kindness to them, part of the covenant promise (Jeremiah 11:4). But that’s not necessarily how the Israelites saw things. When Jeremiah writes of the stiff-necked Israelites who have repeatedly turned away from God, he writes confidently of how the Lord will act “because they had not done what [He] commanded them to do” (v.8).\nThe book of Jeremiah shows God’s justice and love: how His perfect character demands perfect righteousness, and how His love for His people is unfailing. Jeremiah didn’t know how that promise would culminate hundreds of years later on the cross where Jesus died, taking on every ounce of God’s just anger and every molecule of God’s perfect love. It is a gift to cling to the steadfast promises of our unchanging God, who is always, perfectly, unchangingly good.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Erin Davis\n\nJeremiah is not the first prophet (nor the last) to grow weary with the wayward. Can’t you just picture his hunched shoulders and deep sighs as he asked, “Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the treacherous live at ease?” (Jeremiah 12:1). \nLike the psalmist who confessed that they envied the prosperity of the wicked (Psalm 73:3), Job whose pain convinced him that the righteous were the butt of every joke (Job 12:1–6), and Jonah, who despaired when the Ninevites received mercy, not wrath (Jonah 4:1–4)— the Bible records a long list of people of faith who had lost faith in humanity. \nAs I read their words, I’m waylaid by the realization that my own heart wants to default to that same setting. It’s so easy to shake my head and wag my finger, to lump mankind into the categories of “us” and “them,” and wonder why those “on the other side” are having all the fun. And yet, we never find God joining the pity parties of the righteous. While His judgments are clear and His righteousness does not bend, He relentlessly chases the lost. In response to Jeremiah’s despondency, God says, “After I have uprooted them, I will once again have compassion on them and return each one to his inheritance and to his land” (Jeremiah 12:15). \nRight here, in the middle of an Old Testament book, we find the message of the gospel, the needed balm for every cynical soul. Jeremiah had forgotten, as we all tend to do, that when compared to God, no one is righteous, not one (Romans 3:10–12)—not even weeping prophets. We deserve death, not mercy. Our pity parties end when we remember we’re all trophies of God’s grace freely given to us. Every single one of us.\nIn Hosea’s prophetic book, it was the Lord’s turn for deep sighs as He lamented, “My people are bent on turning from me” (Hosea 11:7). The reality of our sin nature is as evident in us today as it ever was then, and yet, this is how our God responds:\n“I will not vent the full fury of my anger; I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim. For I am God and not man, The Holy One among you; I will not come in rage” (Hosea 11:9). \nWhen it looks like the lost have something we are lacking, may the gospel remind us that we have been given grace over and over again. We have Christ. In Him, we have everything.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nI just couldn’t get past the dirty underwear in today’s reading. I kept trying to be a grownup, and look for the big picture to find the deeper meaning. But picturing a venerable and vulnerable Jeremiah wedging underwear between rocks down by the river is a tough image to get past. I looked for other translations for the underwear and found: linen belt, loincloth, waistband, sash, girdle, undergarment, and linen shorts.\nNow, I love a breathable fabric just as much as anyone, but no matter how you slice it, it’s an intimate garment that’s been trashed. And it’s a metaphor for how the Lord has brought His people close and they turned out to be of no use, and rather an embarrassment, actually (Jeremiah 13:8–11). They’d refused to obey, fought among themselves, and had become proud, forgetting the Lord and trusting in lies instead (v.25). This is a picture of a people who have failed to heed the Lord’s warning to listen to Him in humility, confess their transgressions, and cry out for mercy (Jeremiah 13:15;14:7). The people of Judah had run after the idolatries of the world, rather than the treasures of the kingdom. \nIt’s a short step to confess that I am guilty of these same sins. All our hearts are idol factories, turning our gaze and affection toward lesser things. Apart from the tender mercies and the arresting grace of God, we will go the way of Israel and Judah, for even our very finest righteousness is as filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6).\nThe startling realization that we are a little like dirty underwear down by the river is the first step to healing. The Lord invites His people to confess their sins and put on the clean garment of His salvation (1 John 1:9). We are called to recognize with David and with Paul that “all have turned away; all alike have become corrupt. There is no one who does good, not even one” (Psalm 14:3; Romans 3:12). But we are not invited to sit and fixate on the filthiness and neediness of humanity. Instead, like Jeremiah, we are to cry out, “Are you not the LORD our God? We therefore put our hope in you” (Jeremiah 14:22).\nHope! We are called to put our hope in the Lord. This was such good news for Judah because they were certainly in a centuries-long snit of their own making. And this is beautiful news for us, too, because we are guilty of the same embarrassing rejections of God’s goodness and kindness toward us. This peculiar passage echoes that same gospel that the prophet Isaiah declared: “We all went astray like sheep; we all have turned to our own way; and the LORD has punished him for the iniquity of us all” (Isaiah 53:6). Though the first note of the gospel is our great guilt, the final note is one of resounding hope, and of praise for the undeserved lovingkindness God shows us.\n\nRebecca Faires loves the gospel story and needs it every morning when she wakes up to her six little people. Rebecca holds a bachelor’s degree in German from Hillsdale College, and most recently worked as the managing editor and writer at She Reads Truth. She now works from her log cabin in the hills of Tennessee, writing and illustrating books with her favorite mountain man.

To be fair, I knew snow was in the forecast, but I also assumed that it was always in the forecast, and therefore, just another Friday in the Windy City. This is one of those areas where people who live in cold-weather states get all puffy in their parkas and tell those of us who live in the blessed South, “Relax. We know how to deal with this. We have snow plows!” \nAfter arriving at the airport at an appropriately early time and confirming my flight’s “on time” status, I was relaxed. But just as I joined the line for coffee to pass the time before boarding, I got the dreaded text: My flight had been “cancelled.” \nThere’s a unique shade of panic when it comes to flight plans becoming totally derailed. You begin with a detailed, minute-by-minute itinerary of how exactly you’ll get from point A to point B, and then one small malfunction, or not-so-small storm, comes along and forces you to watch each well-planned step unravel before your very eyes. \nThe Israeilites knew what it was like to not have things go according to plan. Today’s reading recalls their deliverance by God from Egypt, which is the central act of redemption in the Old Testament. Throughout Scripture, God continues to remind His people of His promise-keeping trustworthiness and steadfast character, but Jeremiah 16 predicts a turbulent journey ahead for God’s people: their coming exile. \n“However, look, the days are coming… when it will no longer be said,  ‘As the LORD lives who brought the Israelites from the land of Egypt,’ but rather,  ‘As the LORD lives who brought the Israelites from the land of the north and from all the other lands where he had banished them.’  For I will return them to their land that I gave to their ancestors” (Jeremiah 16:14–15).\nA reroute doesn’t disqualify you from ending up where you’re supposed to be. In the case of the Israelites, who I imagine probably just wanted to end up somewhere safe, God didn’t just get them from point A to point B; He gave them freedom, releasing them from captivity and slavery, and brought them home. \nGod’s plan isn’t just to redirect us—it’s to redeem and restore us. He may not provide a step-by-step itinerary or a packing list, but I do believe that if we read the pages of Scripture and remember who He has been to us in the past, we get something even more important: a picture of His character. We don’t need to know the inclement weather plan or be reminded to put on our own air masks before assisting someone else. We just need to know who is in charge. And that is more than enough. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nNo one told me this outright, but from an early age I felt that if I stopped doing good things, bad things would happen. On a big and small scale, this seemed to be the way the world worked, at least, I’d perceived it that way. I reasoned that since the world naturally flows toward disorder, my intervention was necessary to hold back the inevitable chaos. Thus began my love affair with productivity. My necessary intervention could range from tackling the mounting pile of dishes in the sink or clothes in the laundry basket, to the gripping fear I feel when I read Edmund Burke’s warning, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” I mean, I can’t do nothing!\nProductivity is attractive because it feels so reasonable and responsible and grown up. Are we not stewards of God’s creation? Aren’t we doing what God designed us to do by being in constant motion? My heart was drawn to the siren’s call of productivity, but since this heart of mine is also more deceitful than anything else (Jeremiah 17:9), I soon found myself in a dilemma. (Does any of this sound familiar?)\nDid God really know what He was asking when He commanded His people to observe the Sabbath, even making it one of the Ten Commandments? Is this really what He intended: \n“You are to labor six days and do all your work,  but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God.  You must not do any work” (Exodus 20:9–10).\nEarly on as I read the Old Testament and saw the countless times Israel refused to observe the Sabbath, even with the threat of severe consequences (Jeremiah 17:23), I wondered, How hard can it be to just stop and do nothing?\nI now see that God’s command to rest on the Sabbath is really a command to trust Him and live out the blessing of being His dependent child. My posture should be that of Jeremiah: “Heal me, LORD, and I will be healed; save me and I will be saved, for you are the one I praise” (v.14). Like Judah’s rejection of the Sabbath, my own refusal to rest shows my fear of trusting Him, of being needy, and my unwillingness to admit that I am ignorant of what is best for me. Resting is not so easy after all. \nHowever, Jesus has done the unimaginable by taking the curse for our stiff-necked defiance, and instead has given us the rest and assurance that we belong to our Heavenly Father when we receive His gift of grace. Now, we are able to “draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water” (Hebrews 10:22). We are now free to rest and “proclaim [His] love in the morning and [His] faithfulness at night,” (Psalm 92:2). We are free to enjoy our work as we revel in “all the great things He has done” for us (1 Samuel 12:24). \nWe are free. \nResting is hardly passive; it is making space to remember and really consider His goodness and faithfulness, and then proclaiming it to others, singing our praise unto Him. This is what my heart truly longs for. \n\nBrooke Kocher is a wife and mother of three. She is a Southern girl at heart and a recent transplant to the Pacific Northwest. \n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nAfter retiring in Kentucky, my uncle took up pottery lessons. Over the year, our family began to acquire a collection of iridescent and cobalt blue bowls and flower pots as he experimented like a mad scientist. He loved working with clay for the same reasons most people do. It’s wet. It’s messy. There’s a form of childlike play to it. You can mold and shape it to make something beautiful in the end. The outcome of the clay is at the mercy of your hands. The same is true of us and our Maker.\nIn the beginning of Jeremiah 18, God says to the prophet: “Go down at once to the potter’s house; there I will reveal my words to you” (v.2). He sends Jeremiah to this house because by observing the potter’s wheel and clay, Jeremiah is given a powerful visual aid. Just like clay in a potter’s hand, the house of Israel is held in its Maker’s hands (v.6). The Israelite people aren’t as independent as they think. They are stubborn and make poor decisions. They abandon their commitment to God and defile the land with idolatry, making it a “horror” (v.16). They don’t realize how fragile they are and what they are risking in order to live according to what they think is right. \nIn Jeremiah 19, God tells Jeremiah to give a sign act to the people of Judah, which is exactly what it sounds like: a physical act that serves as a sign. He instructs Jeremiah to buy a potter’s clay jar, proclaim God’s judgment against Judah, and says, “Then you are to shatter the jar in the presence of the people going with you” (Jeremiah 19:10). The sign was meant to represent His intentions toward unrepentant Judah. \nGod takes great care to speak in ways we can understand. He’ll use everything from visual aids to metaphors to get our attention; even the world around us reveals His character. As we read through Jeremiah’s prophecies, may we trust that God knows what is best for us, and look for where He may be trying to reveal His truth to us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitie Stoddard\n\nHave you ever felt God place a message on your heart that you couldn’t help but share? Sometimes that calling arrives on your doorstep when you least expect it. That was the case for me when my daughter was diagnosed with Down syndrome. God has used her life to show me His deep love for all people, regardless of their abilities or achievements. My eyes have been opened to the shortcomings in my own heart, and in the heart of our culture, to affirm the worth of every human being because they are made in the image of God. I knew God was leading me to spread the word about how “perfectly and wonderfully made” people with Down syndrome are.\nSometimes the task God gives us is unpopular. The truth can be divisive, and by sharing the truth of the gospel we may lose friends, family, and opportunities. In some parts of the world, the consequences of faith are far more dire, putting the very lives of believers at risk for preaching the Word. The prophet Jeremiah was no stranger to persecution. He was given the dangerous assignment of calling Jerusalem out for their injustice and unfaithfulness to God. And while he was faithful to preach that message, it was not without internal wrestling. \nOne might look at the prophets of old and assume that witnessing is somehow easier for them than it is for you and me. We might think they liked the public stage and all that came with it. But Jeremiah makes it clear he would run away from the spotlight in a second if it didn’t mean running away from God too. So why doesn’t Jeremiah forget the risky business of prophecy and find a more convenient, safe way to serve God? Jeremiah is compelled to speak out because, as he said, the Lord’s message “becomes a fire burning in my heart, shut up in my bones. I become tired of holding it in” (Jeremiah 20:9). His heart is so deeply tethered to the Lord’s that he cannot waver from his created purpose.\nAs followers of Jesus, God places specific callings to our lives through the movement of the Holy Spirit in us. For each one of us, the big-picture calling is to proclaim the name of Jesus. But we have all been entrusted with unique circumstances and gifts that shape the way we point the world to Christ. \nWhat is the specific “burning” you feel in your bones? Are you being faithful to proclaim it? While it’s tempting to let the fear of repercussion silence you, look to the faith of Jeremiah for courage. He was a man who preached a dangerous message and experienced the backlash, but knew deep down he could do nothing less. The reason Jeremiah was able to be so bold was not because he was strong or special, but because he trusted that God is a “violent warrior,” one who could not be stopped (Jeremiah 20:11). That same powerful God is calling you and me to share the truth with the world in a very particular way. He will be with us every step of the way. The question is, will we let God speak through our lives?\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Claire Gibson\n \nI’m sitting at my dining room table on the verge of tears. It’s been a good day, really. I slept in, made breakfast for my family, went to the gym, ate a nutritious lunch, and now, the toddler is napping and I’m sitting here, feeling so empty I could cry.\nSome modern-day advice-givers would be quick to point out my many blessings; for one, my family is intact and loving toward one another. Other people might try to help by pointing me in the direction of self-help guides, books to help me cope better because people like me shouldn’t be feeling any existential or emotional angst. Still others might remind me that the universe “has my back,” that in the end, everything is going to be okay. But is it? On the surface, my circumstances don’t justify this level of emotion. And yet, I have this sense, deep down, that something is wrong, that even though everything on the surface seems okay, everything on the surface isn’t all there is.\nThat’s what’s happening in this cryptic chapter of Jeremiah. The people of Israel had been led astray by false teachers—teachers that Scripture likens to “evil shepherds.” These teachers told the people that everything was fine. Even if they lived lives of evil, these teachers promised that God would grant them peace (Jeremiah 23:17). The false teachers encouraged people to persist in their godless actions, and when the people felt the inklings of sadness creep up—sadness that might lead them to repentance—the evil teachers distracted the people with stories of their dreams and false words wrongly attributed to God. \nAnd here’s something important to take away from this passage: God has no patience for people who speak on his behalf, and speak falsely. As I write this devotion that a large community of women from all around the world will read, I should take this warning to heart. Those who attempt to communicate truths from Scripture are held to a high, exacting standard. \nSometimes, a shepherd must strike the sheep with his crook in order to keep the flock together. Sometimes those are acts of mercy. Words of kindness and encouragement have their place. Words of discipline and correction are just as valuable. But I need a doctor that won’t sugarcoat my diagnosis. I need a friend who can look me in the eye and say, “Yes, this sadness that you feel is real, and it’s stemming from the fact that your entire life is structured around serving your own needs and desires, rather than serving others.” I need teachers who will tell me the truth, even when the truth hurts. \nWe live in a culture that longs for God to be all-merciful, all-healing, all-loving—and He is. And yet, over and over again in Scripture, He uses images like the good and bad figs (Jeremiah 24) to represent the reality that there will come a judgment day when our actions will be measured and weighed. Knowing this, the Lord again provided another way so that one day, His sheep will no longer be afraid or discouraged, nor will any be missing. He declared:\n“Look, the days are coming”—this is the LORD’s declaration— “when I will raise up a Righteous Branch for David” (Jeremiah 23:5).\nOur lives here matter. Our choices here matter. And when we go astray, our God doesn’t shout orders to us from afar to get us back to where we belong. No, our Savior came to us to provide a way to God the Father. And when we go astray, Christ doesn’t shout that He loves us from afar; He provides a way to God on our behalf, one that stretches between the Father and us. Through Jesus Christ, “he has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son he loves. In him we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins” (Colossians 1:13–14).The end goal isn’t just heaven someday. It’s being close to God right now, today.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nFor twenty-three years, Jeremiah pleaded for his people to pay attention. I wonder if he felt helpless as he watched his neighbors in Judah build their Asherah poles and bow to the stars and Baal. Perhaps he felt a knot in his stomach whenever he saw the shimmering idols, or laid awake at night weeping for the children sacrificed to bloodthirsty false gods (Jeremiah 7:31; 2 Kings 17:7–17).\nIt’s the same helplessness we feel when a loved one makes one destructive choice after another, or when we see the church we love caught up in shame and scandal. An all too human helplessness, knowing that no matter how much we plead, cry, warn, or rage, we can’t force anyone to change.\nNow take that feeling, that longing, and set it next to the deep well of sorrow and anger in Jeremiah’s words. See it as only a pale reflection of the depths of God’s broken heart. This hard passage forces us to wrestle with questions of suffering and judgment and anger. God is tired of watching this chosen nation waste their inheritance and love on empty idols. Instead of following the humble way—seeing their land as a gift and honoring the Giver with their lives—they start to imitate their powerful neighbors. With a king and some land and a little bit of power, they seem to forget their utter dependence on the Creator, and when prophets come along to warn them of danger, they shrug it off and keep living comfortably. Jeremiah laments, “You have not obeyed or even paid attention. He announced, ‘Turn, each of you, from your evil way of life and from your evil deeds. Live in the land the LORD gave to you and your ancestors long ago and forever’” (Jeremiah 25:4–5). In the end, they brought disaster on themselves (v.7).\nWhat do we do with the tension between this explosive message and God’s unrelenting mercy? Because for all these words about wrath and judgment, we know this broken path will someday lead to Jesus, God in vulnerable human form. We know further in the future, Jesus’s friend Peter will write once again about suffering, reminding a new generation that judgment and cleansing sometimes have to “begin with God’s household” (1 Peter 4:17). And we know that it is even so today, when secret sin is exposed, when leaders are brought low, when we find ourselves confronting the violent legacy of generations before us.\nIt’s sobering, but this suffering isn’t meant to bring shame. In this season of Lent, maybe it’s helpful to remember that repentance begins in the smallest of ways, perhaps with these two simple words: pay attention. Pay attention to your life, to the little choices. Do they nudge you toward life or death? Do they keep you humbly looking more like Jesus, or do they help you climb higher in the systems of the world? Repentance means, quite literally, turning around when you see yourself on the road to destruction. May we all join the weeping prophet in calling each other to a better way, and “entrust ourselves to a faithful Creator while doing what is good” (1 Peter 4:19).\n\nJen Rose Yokel is a poet, writer, a spiritual director in training, and a contributing writer at The Rabbit Room.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nMy two-year old attends a sweet little church preschool a few days a week. This Christmas season, she brought home a nativity craft which met the fate of most crafts in our home: tossed aside, buried under mail, and found a few days later. My five-year-old daughter, who had discovered it as I was making dinner one evening, yelled from across the kitchen table:\n“MOM!” she giggled. “Is baby Jesus a potato?”\nI continued stirring the soup, and without even looking up, I chastised her immediately. “That’s not very nice! Baby Jesus is NOT a potato.”\n“But, MOM, look!”\nThen she appeared next to me, holding a small Yukon Gold potato, wrapped in tissue, with a drawn-on smiley face. Huh. Well, what do you know? In this scenario, baby Jesus was, indeed, a potato. I hadn’t even looked up, so how could I have known? How could I have expected a potato masquerading as the King of kings? \nThe priests, prophets, and all the people in Jeremiah 26 were a bit like me, stirring soup and not even looking up, jumping to an instant conclusion. Now sure, “You must die!” is a bit more extreme of a response than, “That’s not very nice.” Still, I know how many times I’ve heard something I just don’t want to hear, let alone deal with, and instead of listening, I react instantly, disproportionately, given the context. Honestly, this happens almost daily. As for Jeremiah, he had prophesied that the temple would become like Shiloh, a city north of Jerusalem that had been utterly destroyed by the Philistines. Psalm 78 recounts the tale: \n“But they rebelliously tested the Most High God, for they did not keep his decrees…  God heard and became furious; he completely rejected Israel.  He abandoned the tabernacle at Shiloh,  the tent where he resided among mankind” (vv.56,59–60).\nNo one, especially not the priests and people in power, wanted to hear that their city and temple would be destroyed because of their actions. Defensiveness reigned, and instead of hearing the word of the Lord and obeying, they tried to (literally) kill the messenger. But the Lord’s providence protected Jeremiah. A few officials stood up and spoke for him, reminding the rest of the group that the prophet Micah had made a similar prophecy (Micah 3:12), and when the people did turn and repent, the Lord relented. \nIn this story we see again, as we have so many times before in Jeremiah, a testament to the unwavering character of God. He does what He says He will do. Jeremiah believed it, and staked his life on it. He took God at His word; if the people would “correct [their] ways and deeds, and obey the LORD [their] God,” He would relent (Jeremiah 26:13).\nAs I read about Jeremiah standing there in the city center and proclaiming the unpopular, death-threatening message from the Lord, I’m reminded of Acts 17, when Paul stands in the areopagus in Athens and gives a similar message: “God now commands all people everywhere to repent” (Acts 17:30). \nThere are others in Scripture who faced a similar situation: Stephen died while proclaiming the history of God’s unfailing covenant (Acts 7). Peter was arrested for standing in the middle of Solomon’s Colonnade in Jerusalem and shouting the truth (Acts 3). Jeremiah, Paul, Stephen, Peter, and countless more before and after, risked their lives to tell the truth. In today’s reading, we see a few leaders who stood up and risked everything to hear it. Truth-telling and truth-hearing are two sides of the same coin, and we are called to do both as followers of the Author of Truth.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nI’m grateful God gives us earthy metaphors to help us grasp spiritual truths. Whether it’s using a mustard seed to represent our faith, sheep to illustrate the waywardness of human beings, or salt to reveal how we can flavor and preserve the world—God often provides familiar word pictures to drive a message home.\nIn today’s reading, God tells Jeremiah, “Make chains and yoke bars for yourself and put them on your neck” (Jeremiah 27:2). A yoke was commonly used to harness oxen as they pulled carts or farming equipment. Two animals would be placed side by side and hoops would be hung under their heads. The hoops would be strapped to a horizontal wooden bar placed across their necks. This yoke would force the strong oxen into submission and labor.\nJeremiah obeyed God’s instruction and strapped a heavy, wooden yoke around his own neck. How strange for a man to harness himself like an animal! The shackled prophet was a shocking picture of what God’s unfaithful people would soon experience. The nation of Judah would be captured, enslaved, and exiled to Babylon: Farewell, freedom! Farewell, promised land! Because of their insatiable idol chasing, God would use Babylon’s King Nebuchadnezzar to bring judgment. Judah would be forced to submit to a foreign power and to labor against their own will. \nJeremiah’s yoke was a picture of God’s severe judgment, but it also revealed God’s severe mercy. Even without Nebuchadnezzar’s invasion, the people of Judah were already slaves. Despite God’s repeated warnings through His commands and prophets, they had shackled themselves to false, foreign gods and they were blind to the chains of idolatry around their own necks. God longed for His people to recognize this bondage, turn away from idolatry, and return to Him with all their heart and with all their soul (Jeremiah 29:12–13). Only then could they really be free.\nWe all worship something. We all bow the knee and chase something or someone in which to put our hope. We may harness ourselves to health, beauty, wealth, family, achievements, or even our own good deeds. But worshiping anything other than God chokes the life right out of us. Our idols promise much, often the kind of peace we all long for, even the prophet Jeremiah (Jeremiah 28:6). And when the promise is made, the chase begins. Our idols fail to deliver, yet they demand more. As the chase goes on, we become more weary, despairing and defeated. But in His mercy, God interrupts our destructive spiral. He points us to the only one who, when we are harnessed to Him, delivers life instead of death. \n\nPatti Sauls lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband Scott and daughters, Abby and Ellie, where they serve alongside the people of Christ Presbyterian Church.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nAre you sitting down? I mean, comfortably? Is everything in order around you—dishwasher running, floors swept, dinner in the oven, finances in order, the right color of throw pillows on your bed, exciting opportunities on the horizon, and peace within and all around you? Sometimes the stars align and all our circumstances seem to be exactly under control. I like to wait for that moment to start writing. Or to sit to read my Bible. I used to feel like I was waiting until I was married to really start living. But now that I am married with a family of my own, there’s always one more piece I determine to be missing from the puzzle—one more excuse to keep me from faithful obedience.\nIt’s hard to lean in and flourish when you’re waiting for everything to be perfect. Judah was in exile, living in Babylon, with every reason to give up and just spend years sitting angrily with their arms crossed. But Jeremiah calls them to walk in ordinary obedience, to be a blessing to the nation they are in. “Pursue the well-being of the city I have deported you to. Pray to the LORD on its behalf, for when it thrives, you will thrive” (Jeremiah 29:7). They had every reason to hate the Babylonians, but they were deported by the righteous judgment of God, who was now calling them to repent, and walk in ordinary, daily obedience. \nOften we want our repentance to be a single extravagant display of remorse. Then, after we think we’ve made a big enough deal about how sorry we are, we want everything to go back to normal: we want to have our own way again, and we want the consequences—the deportations, so to speak—to be reversed. But here we learn much about the true nature of grace and a relationship with God: repentance and forgiveness, obedience and blessing.\nFirst, true repentance isn’t focused on the removal of consequences. It is a return to obedience. Genuine remorse for sin produces a heart that turns away from sin and loves righteousness, no matter the circumstances. Second, God’s forgiveness isn’t really even about circumstances. We can’t judge our position before God simply by how well we seem to be doing on the outside. His forgiveness begins by changing our hearts and our spiritual position before Him. Our temporal circumstances are a secondary matter. Third, God calls us to obedience at all times. Repentance produces obedience, and grace bears the fruit of obedience. Obedience is the right response to every circumstance, whether good or ill. And ordinary, daily obedience—loving our neighbors, being fruitful, making disciples—is to be a continual mark of God’s people.\nWe are called to be a blessing, even to our captors. Though this runs counter to every human inclination, it should be no surprise. It is, after all, at the heart of God’s covenant promise to Abraham: “All the peoples on earth will be blessed through you” (Genesis 12:3), and in Christ’s command to His disciples: “Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you” (Matthew 5:44).\nEvery judgment of God is a gift of His mercy and grace. Even in a foreign land, God promises His people the grace of His presence: “I will be found by you” (Jeremiah 29:14). As He forgives their iniquities, He gives them Himself, and beckons them to share their knowledge of Him with the nations. This is the call that has gone out since the beginning of the world: repent and believe in the one true God. Be fruitful and multiply. Go and make disciples. For the kingdoms of this world will “become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and he will reign forever and forever” (Revelation 11:15, ESV). \nWe are all sojourners in a strange land, wanderers like Abraham, like Israel and Judah. Christ calls us to allegiance to a kingdom that is not of this world: to pray to Him and search for Him with all our hearts (Jeremiah 29:12–13). He calls us to remember that whether we are in our own land or in exile, we are ambassadors for His kingdom. The ordinary obedience of believers is perhaps the chief defense to a watching world, the beauty of the gospel pointing to the glory of the kingdom of Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nYou may have seen Siena, Italy, on the news, either because of the coronavirus-related quarantine in the area or because its residents were filmed singing from their windows in the face of such hardship, but it has long been one of my favorite places in the world. While Americans have football and the Super Bowl, the Sienese have horse races and the Il Palio di Siena every July and August. Not unlike our own strong team affiliations, these Italians are die-hard fans for their individual contrada, or city division. You see, Siena is divided into ten contrade, each represented by a horse and a rider donning representative colors and flags. \nThe race itself takes place in the city center, and includes three laps around the piazza which take roughly ninety seconds, on average. Yet it’s the most-anticipated and beloved ninety seconds of the year; the rest of the year is spent in support of their home-turf contrada, waving flags and supporting their horse and rider, as well as the division itself, a loyalty that is passed down through generations to enjoy and carry on into the future. \nIn Jeremiah 30, we read about another kind of communal loyalty to tradition. Judah thought they’d never see their own ancestral land again. God, however, had different plans, and a new covenant: “I will restore them to the land I gave to their ancestors and they will possess it” (Jeremiah 30:3).\nWhen I think of God’s people returning home, I can’t help but picture the reunion in the same style of celebration as Il Palio—bright colors, hooping and hollering, beaming with pride and excitement, as they “come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion… radiant with joy” (Jeremiah 31:12). Except this time, it’s God who is cheering on His children. It is He who is most excited to claim victory and freedom for His beloved and see them back home where they belong. Just as the Italians spent all year preparing for Il Palio, I like to picture God orchestrating the new covenant, anticipating radiant shouts of joy, long before His people returned home. \nAs we’ve journeyed through the book of Jeremiah, there have been warnings about the future and mountain-top moments of returning-home joy. But at the heart of this book and this Lenten season of remembrance and repentance is this: God can be trusted to hold both sorrow and joy, and He is faithful through it all. Thanks be to Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nConfession: often, when I read the Bible, I’m less interested in what’s happening in the passage and more focused on what’s in it for me: What does this passage mean for me today? How can it help, comfort, console, or advise me right now? But rather than trying to turn it into a self-help book that is tailor-made to fix all of my own personal problems, I need to remember that the book of Jeremiah is a prophetic book written to a specific people at a specific point in history, though it also gives us a glimpse of the new covenant (Jeremiah 31:31–34). \nIn Jeremiah 32, something strange happens. Jeremiah dreams that someone will come and offer him the chance to purchase a field. Sure enough, his cousin comes to him and offers him the chance to buy a piece of land. However, the timing of this land purchase is odd; while the entire nation of Israel is in exile, away from the promised land, Jeremiah is reinvesting in it, doubling down on God’s promise. In essence, Jeremiah’s actions are saying that even though God’s people are in exile, He still has plans for the land and for His people. Jeremiah’s purchase is designed to demonstrate his faith in God’s promised restoration, and in purchasing the land, he participates in that restoration. \nJeremiah’s prayer is simultaneously one of great faith and confusion. At the end of his prayer of praise, Jeremiah rehashes all of the disaster that has come upon Judah. Their city is under siege, sword, famine, and plague, and yet God has asked the prophet to do this seemingly ridiculous thing: to buy a piece of land in the middle of a war zone. But God keeps His promises, something Jeremiah knew well. So while he was perplexed by God’s request, he continued to act on God’s orders anyway. \nThough I should resist trying to translate this story directly to my own life, I cannot help but be amazed by Jeremiah’s willingness to follow the Lord in everything. He did not wait to completely understand God’s calling, to understand why, in order to obey Him. Obedience is hard, and the truth is, we need God to help us obey Him. \nLord, Your thoughts and ways are better than our own. Help us to trust you and strengthen us to obey You, even when we do not understand what You are doing.\n\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nKids have an uncanny knack for extending their bedtime routine way longer than it needs to last. They try delaying the inevitable by distracting you with all manner of things, like missing pajamas, a long-winded yarn about a sibling, or a third reading of Goodnight, Moon. Unless your kid is one of those miracle children who quickly settles into sleep, as soon as you turn off the lights and shut the door, you hear it: the call of distress. \nSometimes you answer right away. Sometimes you don’t (especially if you know the routine like the back of your hand). Eventually, you may have to let the child’s cries for one more story go unmet for the evening, even when your heart moves with the desire to give in because, at the end of the day, you can only read Goodnight, Moon so many times.\nBut God always wants us to call out to Him in our distress. We see this after the word of the Lord comes to Jeremiah a second time and God says, “Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and incomprehensible things you do not know” (Jeremiah 33:1,3). Our cries for help are really opportunities for connection with Him, for sharing great and incomprehensible things with us. As with Jeremiah, these “things” aren’t self-evident based on our experience, but given to us as insight and revelation that comes from a life of walking with God. They come from a life of crying out to Him and waiting for Him to answer. Early on in life, Jeremiah received a crash course in this practice, one that was necessary in order to follow in the steps God had prepared for his life. \nThe Book of Psalms also features this theme prominently. “Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; he saved them from their distress” (Psalm 107:19). This call and response pattern repeats itself in beautiful depictions of God saving people from places of despondency caused by internal or external circumstances, and sometimes, both. Again and again, we hear God answering them when the time is right and with just the right antidote. \nGod urges us to cry out for help, like a child. We are His children, after all, and we don’t exist outside of His provision no matter how autonomous we may feel. Just like the familiar pages of a well-loved storybook, God longs to comfort us in our distress (Isaiah 30:18). Just as a parent answers a child in their distress because they hate the darkness, God wants to answer us in ours, to meet us in our need. His response to our affliction, and His timing, may look as different as the affliction itself, but He never leaves us in our distress. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nThe last fire truck just disappeared down our driveway. Our woods have been thoroughly soaked with water and while my kids’ eyes are big, their stories are already even bigger. I can still smell the wet wood steam, and the wind is just as strong as it was thirty minutes ago, when a small bonfire caught the wind and flew across the dead leaves, spreading down the hill in the high winds before I could get it back under control. Everyone and everything is okay, but I can’t help but wonder, Could I have prevented this?\nI don’t have a great history with fire. When I was a child, I apparently left one candle burning on one blanket-covered bed and certain responsible adults still see fit to bring it up every Easter. (You’d think I would have learned, right?) But despite all of my past fire-related transgressions, I believe I should be forgiven these mistakes since everything turned out alright in the end.\nWe are accustomed to think of God’s grace as a “get out jail free” card, one that is indiscriminately available to cover whatever we can dish out. This is the natural bent of the human heart. We don’t really see all that much wrong with how we live, because we live in a culture of self-definition: I decide what is right for me, and no one should judge me for it. But what happens to that logic when we come face to face with a holy God?\nWe know what God’s Word says. But do we listen? God set before us the example of the Rechabites in contrast to the promiscuous culture of Judah under Jehoiakim’s reign. The Rechabites listened to the words of their ancestor, Jonabab, while Judah wouldn’t even listen to the Word of God. The Rechabites continued in obedience, generation after generation, resulting in God’s assurance that “Jonadab son of Rechab will never fail to have a man to stand before [God] always” (Jeremiah 35:19). Meanwhile, Judah continued on in their rebellion, despite repeated prophetic warning. \nThe people of Judah had so hardened their hearts that they utterly dismissed the dire warnings of God’s impending judgment—evidenced by the king throwing the warnings into the fire. In the context of this passage, this stubborness is shocking and disturbing. But are we so different? \nThe truth begins with tough news: Our hearts “are more deceitful than anything else” (Jeremiah 17:9). Acknowledging this fact leads us to the next unsettling truth: We have to deal with a Holy God. What can we do in the face of His righteous judgment? We cannot cure our own hearts, and He cannot abide wickedness, nor will He be deceived or mocked (Galatians 6:7). The hardened heart responds to the gospel like Jehoiakim: with denial and unbelief. Such a heart casts aside every warning, arrogantly dismissing the authority and holiness of God. And “it is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God” (Hebrews 10:31).\nThere is only the way of life or the way of death. Our merciful God opens the door to the way of life, even to rebellious Judah: “Perhaps when the house of Judah hears about all the disaster I am planning to bring on them, each one of them will turn from his evil way. Then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin” (Jeremiah 36:3). God not only offers an undeserving and rebellious people the gift of forgiveness, He also graciously offers blessing to those who hunger and thirst for righteousness and love to walk in His law (Matthew 5:6). Through His grace, God extends to us a promise not unlike the one He offered to the Rechabites: the ongoing blessings of His covenant.\nDo not harden your heart. Receive the grace available to you through Jesus! Turn away from evil. Do not throw His warnings into the fire, but instead live in the goodness of all He has given you. Because of Jesus, God will abundantly pardon, and grant you peace and joy everlasting.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nI have two daughters, ages five and two. My two-year-old loves to eat and doesn’t understand boundaries, and my five-year-old likes to be busy, which means she leaves her food lying around in her wake. I’ll let you guess what happens more often than not. And despite my repeated warnings to my eldest—that if she leaves her uneaten food lying around, her sister will likely find and consume it—she continues to do the same thing, over and over again. Needless to say, tears ensue. I realize it’s probably not great parenting to say, “I told you so!” But really, what else is there to say? It’s a cause-and-effect problem, a black-and-white (and no gray) situation. \nWhen Jeremiah speaks to Zedekiah in today’s passage, there’s a similar sentiment behind the message, one in which a half-hearted response just won’t do. There’s really no gray area to wonder, Well, maybe that’s not really what Jeremiah meant, or Maybe the consequences won’t really be as bad as he says they will. But what did Jeremiah actually say? Surrender to the Chaldeans, and you will live. Don’t surrender, and you will die (Jeremiah 38:2,18,23). Over and over again, Jeremiah relays this message, then gets thrown down a well for saying it, only to then say it again. \nI find myself wishing that God always spoke this clearly. I couldn’t possibly count up all the seasons in my life when I have prayed desperately for clarity, for a sign in the sky, for a prophet to appear and speak with such thorough conviction. But even if God were to act in this way, would I actually believe Him? Would I, like King Zedekiah, come up with a list of reasons why I might possibly do the thing I was so clearly instructed not to do?\nZedekiah listened to the officials who said Jeremiah must be wrong, allowing them to throw him down the cistern. Later, Zedekiah was afraid of how the Judeans would treat him if he listened to Jeremiah and surrendered, and so he told Jeremiah to not tell anyone about the conversation. You can probably guess the outcome. The Lord spoke with conviction, but the king did not listen. \nWhile I wish I were more like Jeremiah, the truth is, I probably live my life a lot more like Zedekiah. I’m able to read God’s Word and then turn around and act in the complete opposite of its instructions. My conversation is not always gracious nor is it seasoned with salt (Colossians 4:6). I love money (Matthew 6:24) and put my hope in all sorts of things other than God (1Peter 1:13). I have very little self-control (Proverbs 25:28), and my heart is often bitter and angry (Ephesians 4:31). \nThe reality is that I want God to be clear in His instruction, but only when it benefits me, when His Word aligns with my self-interests and goals. When He is clear and it stings a little, or when He asks me to sacrifice or change for my good and His glory, I pretend that’s not really what He’s saying. But even though I see myself in the willful, self-justifying defiance of Zedekiah, I can rest assured knowing that his fate is not mine, because of the person and work of Jesus Christ. When I look to Jesus, there is no cost too great to follow Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Erin Davis\n\nSuffering has a way of shoving cotton in my ears. When the going gets tough, I have a bad habit of convincing myself that God has stopped speaking altogether. At times, I find myself squashed by my perception that the Spirit has simply gone silent on me. \nBut then I read the words of Jeremiah, the prophet who spent his days weeping (with good cause) over God’s people and their disobedience, and I am reminded that God is hardly indifferent to us, our sin, or our suffering. Within today’s reading alone, just three little chapters of Jeremiah’s story, we find that his city of Jerusalem besieged as pagan officials laid in wait to accost his neighbors. The king fled and was captured… and then had his eyes gouged out. The sons and nobles of Jeremiah’s homeland were then slaughtered, and his countrymen were carried away into exile. And the cisterns that were meant to hold water were instead filled with the bodies of those who were slain (Jeremiah 39–40). Keep in mind: that’s just three chapters. \nJeremiah himself was left to live as a prisoner among the most destitute of his brethren. This single snapshot of Jeremiah’s story contains more heartache than you and I will likely ever know. Yet it was at that moment that “the word of the LORD had come to Jeremiah when he was confined in the guard’s courtyard” (Jeremiah 39:15). The sound of God’s voice speaking in Jeremiah’s darkest moment unstops my ears and reminds me that the things of this world, even the political upheaval of leaders, cannot squelch the word of the Lord; His plans will succeed. Suffering, imprisonment, and sorrows—none of these are a match for God’s power and goodness. There is no prison that can lock out God’s voice, nor is there a ruler who can censor Him. \nWith every form of comfort stripped from Jeremiah, what a balm God’s presence and voice must have been! The Book of Jeremiah is proof that there is nothing God’s children cannot endure as long as the Lord is still speaking. On every peak and in every valley, in times of plenty and in times of want, whether everything is coming up roses, or all we see is darkness—if we listen for the voice of our Shepherd, we will find that He is still speaking. He is not indifferent but engaged. God Himself is still wooing, always calling His children back to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitie Stoddard\n\nEveryone in the whole city wanted to know God’s will for them, or so they said. But when the Lord’s instructions didn’t match up with what the people of Judah wanted to hear, they quickly made up excuses to dismiss the message and the messenger. \nGod spoke through Jeremiah and told the people to stay put, but they trusted their own plans over His. “Surely Egypt will be better,” they arrogantly thought. Much like when Eve bit into the forbidden fruit, the people placed themselves on the throne to judge what was best for their lives. In doing so, they failed to trust God. It’s a mistake that humankind has made repeatedly since the beginning of time. But just as God was trying to protect Adam and Eve when He warned them not to eat the fruit in the garden, He was trying to protect the people of Judah. It’s important to realize that God wasn’t being controlling or trying to ruin their fun, rather, He knew that if they followed their own path it would lead straight to death (Jeremiah 42:22).\nI’m sure we’ve all asked God for wisdom and direction in big and small decisions. But can you think of a time when you weren’t really open to hearing the Father’s answer? Maybe you already had your mind made up about what you wanted to do or what you thought was best. But when God started to speak to you, were you willing to hear what He had to say? Was your heart ready to obey?\nLike Adam and Eve, and the people Jeremiah prophesied to, most of the time we are not setting out to purposely rebel against God. The problem is actually more deeply rooted in our hearts than that. The reason we struggle to obey God is because we struggle to trust God. While we profess with our lips that God is a good and wise King, our actions sometimes show that we put more stock in our own judgment and abilities to run the show. But just as it was for the first man and woman, and the stubborn people of Judah, our own steps unguided by the light of the Holy Spirit always lead to the dead end of death.\nWe must trust God more and trust ourselves less; He must increase, and we must decrease (John 3:30). None of us are perfect in this area. Not one. But we don’t need to figure this out alone. God knows this fault in us, and it’s exactly why He came to save us from ourselves. We have a rescuer who will go after us no matter how far we’ve wandered from the path. Like a good Shepherd, our God will chase down the lost sheep and bring us back into the fold (Luke 15:4). And bit by bit, as we learn to trust God to lead our lives, we will experience life, abundant life.Through communion with God, we will be “transformed into the same image from glory to glory” (2 Corinthians 3:18).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Erin Davis\n\nIt is part of my parenting philosophy to never ask this question: “Why?”\nWhen my toddler draws all over the wall with a Sharpie… When my pre-teen opts to stuff all of his dirty laundry under his bed instead of in the hamper nearby… When my kindergartener bursts into sudden tears because he can’t find the green crayon… \nI’ve found that asking, “Why?” is more often than not met with bewildered stares, rather than deep, philosophical answers. And yet, in Jeremiah 44, when the Isrealites countered the news of God’s imminent judgment by digging in their heels, God, our loving Father, looked at His children and lovingly asked, “Why?”\n“Why do you commit this great evil against yourselves?…  Why do you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands” (vv.7–8, ESV). \nOur all-knowing, all-powerful God knew the answer, of course. But like all parents who struggle to fathom why their child would make a choice that leads to destruction, God voices His exasperation over His children’s persistent rebellion. The Isrealites in Jeremiah’s time were no different from us. Since the garden of Eden, all of humanity has been grossly warped by sin. Our very cells are broken; we run in glad rebellion away from the things of God. Like the apostle Paul, we are left to wonder, Why can’t I live the life Christ has called me to live? (Romans 7:15–20). \nWhen our questions lead to discouraging answers, and we face the fact that the destruction we read about in Jeremiah is a picture of the punishment we deserve, Scripture invites us to ask a better question. Not why, but who. Who can save us from our sin and spare us from the punishment we deserve? \nJesus! Our righteous Savior, who took the punishment we earned, so that we might be spared the righteous judgment of the Father. When the weight of our sin feels crushing and the reality of our rebellion overwhelms us, we don’t need to bother with asking, “Why?” Instead, we can rest in the hope found in asking, “Who?”\n“Who can bring an accusation against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies” (Romans 8:33). Jesus alone is the answer, and nothing can separate us from His love (v.34,38).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Maria Furlough\n\nSix years ago, on this day, I said both hello and goodbye to my sweet baby boy Gideon. Through his life and death, I tasted destruction and the threat of despair for the very first time. I moaned and wept as the walls I had built around my life came crashing down. I wondered, can God possibly heal this?\nThe words of Jeremiah chapters 46–48 detail another destruction story, one where we find despair in almost every verse, leaving us to wonder if hope for humanity is even possible. Can God possibly heal this?  \nThe people of Egypt “are terrified, they are retreating… terror is on every side!” (Jeremiah 46:5). The Philistines “will cry out, and every inhabitant will wail… they will be utterly helpless” (Jeremiah 47:2–3). The Moabites “will be shattered; her little ones will cry out” (Jeremiah 48:4). Darkness had fully overtaken these countries, and we learn why: because they trusted in their “work and treasures” (Jeremiah 48:7). And yet, for those who put their trust in God, there is a light that rises up. In the middle of the dark, destruction, and despair, we see that God has never left the side of those who call Him Lord.\nNo one in humanity is spared; death will reach each and everyone of us. At some point, whether Israelite or Egyptian, Christian or non-Christian, the walls of our lives, our cities, our possessions will come crashing down. But for those who do put their hope in God, we are not to be afraid because He promises to be with us (Jeremiah 46:27–28). Our hope does not lie in circumstances, works, or treasures; therefore, we have nothing to fear.\n“Do not be afraid.” These were the words my sweet Jesus brought to my mind every morning after Gideon died. In the moments when I was beating my pillow and pleading with God to somehow give me my baby back, He was with me. In the mornings when I wept at Gideon’s graveside, wondering if I would ever get up, God was there. This is the promise we have when we give our lives to Jesus. When we choose to follow God, when we accept Jesus’s death for us as atonement for our sins, and when we seek to follow Him each and every day, then even when terror and wailing come, we have hope.\nSo He’s shown me the answer to my question is, yes, God can heal even this, whatever this may be. And so it is within these passages from Jeremiah: Yes, God can heal this too. Therefore, we stand in confidence, and in all things remember that, “As for man, his days are like grass… But from eternity to eternity, the LORD’s faithful love is toward those who fear him” (Psalm 103:15,17).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nWhat’s the opposite of a banner year? Whatever it is, that’s what our family has experienced in the last year. Grief, frustration, brokenness, envy, death, and sickness stretched us out like a rubber band, taking us further than we thought we physically had the capacity to go. \nAt some point, every response started to seem rote, even the biblical ones. I stopped talking to certain people, because I knew they would offer a platitude that did nothing to assuage the torrent of grief and sadness. I longed for a true reprieve, a glimpse of the promise that I know in my bones is true: that one day there will be no more sadness and no more death (Revelation 21:4). \nThe brutal prophecies against the nations in the final few chapters of Jeremiah feel like that: unrelenting, devastating, impossible to withstand. Chapter 49 unwinds the devastations that were to come: the land of Ammon would be like a desolate mound; the chief city Bozrah would be destroyed, “an example for cursing” (v.13). Edom would become insignificant among all nations and uninhabitable (vv.15); fires would consume Damascus (v.27); Elam would lose the source of their power and be finished off, their kings destroyed (vv.35, 37–38). But then we read this: \n“Yet, in the last days, I will restore the fortunes of Elam.  This is the LORD’s declaration” (v.39).\nThere are short verses tucked in each chapter that promise restoration—the Egyptians (Jeremiah 46:26), the Moabites (48:47), the Ammonites (49:6), and the Elamites. And earlier in Jeremiah, God made a promise to His people, the people of Judah who had betrayed Him: “‘I will restore your fortunes, and gather you from all the nations and places where I banished you’—this is the LORD’s declaration. ‘I will restore you to the place from which I deported you’” (Jeremiah 29:14).\nThis is because our just God is also our merciful God. Even in the midst of judgment, executed in His perfect justice and righteousness, He promises to restore His people. He promises to restore their enemies. God is so big and so good. \nJeremiah is a study of God’s character. The reality of His grace and His justice is too much for our brains to comprehend. How, after all the things the Elamites and Ammonites and Egyptians and Moabites did to the people of God, could He promise to restore them? How, after all the ways His people betrayed Him, could God show them mercy? I do not understand it. But I know I need that same mercy.\nCharles Spurgeon, a British theologian and pastor, said: “God’s mercy is so great that you may sooner drain the sea of its water, or deprive the sun of its light, or make space too narrow, than diminish the great mercy of God.” It is this great mercy of our good and just God that we see woven throughout this chapter of desolation. Thanks be to Him. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nA long time ago, maybe fifteen years or so, my friends invited me to watch a movie with them. I didn’t check on which movie was playing—who even cared? We settled in, giggling, with popcorn and candy. Then I lifted my eyes to the screen and saw the most terrifying previews of horrible things I had never even imagined—in the previews! I knew for certain that I was not going to stay in my seat, essentially paying my money and my time to be tormented. \nThe fun and the danger of the world are balanced on a thin line. I wouldn’t have forfeited my eternal soul by viewing such a harrowing film. God isn’t going to yank away my salvation because of a party I went to in college, but our little everyday decisions do set the course of our life. It’s tempting to follow the course of the world and leave the course of godliness for another day.\nThis passage foretells the judgment God brought against the Babylonian empire. We see its fulfillment in the Medo-Persian conquest of Babylon during the time of Daniel. While Babylon feasted, the Medes and Persians invaded and toppled the wicked and unsuspecting empire.\nWhile there is specific fulfillment historically recorded, we also see with great clarity the character of God and His judgments against wickedness itself. As God called His people to depart from wicked Babylon, so He has always called us to be set apart from the world. While we are in the world, we are not of it. We are called to be a peculiar people, a holy priesthood set apart for good works (1 Peter 2:9).\nJeremiah’s call to separate from Babylon is set amidst an overwhelming series of warnings and foretellings of doom. The destruction of Babylon is coming, an unstoppable and devastating judgment. Here we see God’s righteous character, which cannot ignore the wickedness of the world; again and again, He condemns them for their idolatry. He will punish their “carved images” because “the LORD is a God of retribution; he will certainly repay” (Jeremiah 51:52,56). This idea of justice can make us a bit uncomfortable, but it is inseparable from the deliverance that God promises to those who trust Him. He cannot abide evil, because it is evil. \nThe lure of worldliness promises us gorgeous wealth, pleasure, and power. However, it will ultimately and inevitably result in the loss of what really matters. Lot was lured by the appeal of worldliness when he settled in Sodom (Genesis 13:8–11). It was in a rich land and offered ample opportunities for economic benefit, but as Peter reminds us, “as that righteous man lived among them day by day, his righteous soul was tormented by the lawless deeds he saw and heard” (2 Peter 2:8).\nGod’s call to His people to flee Babylon is a call not only to flee final desolation that comes to a wicked and perverse culture, but also to flee from the tormenting of our souls by a close association with worldliness. On the other side of this warning, we also see a welcome promise. God doesn’t simply call us away from Babylon; He calls us to something: \n“I will return Israel to his grazing land, and he will feed on Carmel and Bashan;  he will be satisfied in the hill country of Ephraim and of Gilead.  In those days and at that time—this is the LORD’s declaration—one will search for Israel’s iniquity, but there will be none,  and for Judah’s sins, but they will not be found,  for I will forgive those I leave as a remnant” (Jeremiah 50:19–20).\nHis promise is this: while the world offers happiness it cannot fully deliver—not for long, anyway—we find in Christ every satisfaction. He calls us to a place of rest and goodness, where the stain and memory of sin itself has been removed. He is the Shepherd of Israel, who leads us to quiet pastures, and to streams of living waters (Psalm 23).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nGrowing up, our family had two favorite traditions on Friday nights: homemade tacos and movies. It was a celebratory way to signal the end of a work/school week with two things that we could all get behind, although agreeing on taco ingredients was far easier than agreeing on a film choice. One night, we chose How Green Was My Valley, based on the 1939 novel by Richard Llewellyn. \nWe had absolutely zero context going into it. Spoiler alert: after spending two hours immersed in heartbreaking conflict, death, and thwarted love set in a grueling coal-mining village, we breathed a sigh of relief and pronounced it “the most depressing thing we’d ever seen.” The movie later became an inside joke in our family. Being more of the Singin’ in the Rain type, any time one of us would suggest another film showing, we’d shout from across the room, “As long as it’s not How Green Was My Valley, right?” \nWhether or not our unprofessional critique was a fair and accurate depiction of the story, this is what much of the book of Jeremiah feels like. It’s a rough read. The fall of Jerusalem is the last account in our Lenten study before entering into Holy Week, and in it an army sieges the city, and people are slaughtered right and left. However, though destruction, exile, and death are emphasized themes, the book ends with Judah’s King Jehoiachin getting released from prison and re-established in the presence of the king of Babylon (Jeremiah 52:31–33). Whew! Yes! At last! After such a heartbreaking saga, we end with gestures of kindness and mercy. But is it enough?\nMaybe it’s a bit of a leap, but we could say that Jeremiah’s conclusion foreshadows our knowledge this side of the cross that just when things look darkest, hope is on the move. God did not abandon His plan for redemption. Although Nebuzaradan burned the Lord’s temple (Jeremiah 52:13), Jeremiah and the people of Judah, Israel, and Babylon are just a few key players on a long timeline of history. Remember that God came as Jesus and allowed the temple of His own body to be destroyed so it could be raised and restored for our salvation (John 2:19–21). \nGoing into today’s reading with this knowledge frames the story in hope. Friends, as we finish Jeremiah’s story, let’s choose to find the incomparable hope nestled among the pages of its conclusion. Because, really, it’s only a temporary conclusion. Mercy is not forgotten. Jesus Christ came, and He is coming again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nI love the exercise of doing something again. I like to read the same great books, over and over. I like to watch the same TV shows, or watch the same movies, and mine them for new gems. I’ve been re-reading all of Jane Austen’s novels over the past few years, and every book has been a delight. If books are prisms, then each new season of life has me looking through a different side, seeing how old and new insights bounce off of each other like light, making the experience richer and brighter each time I read. \nSometimes, reading Scripture is like that, especially reading beloved passages like the one today from Luke 19. Perhaps this is your first time ever reading the story of Jesus’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, kicking off the final series of events before His death. Perhaps you’ve read it dozens of times, and as you read it this morning your eyes skimmed over it, connecting only with the keywords you know to expect. \nBecause Scripture is a means of grace, it reads us as much as we read it. Like a prism, it catches light no matter when we look at it, and illuminates something deeper and richer. Scripture is living and active, which means that if we approach it with prayer, the Holy Spirit will guide us, and it will always reveal something to us. \nI can imagine the cries of the crowd who cheered for Jesus were staccato: sharp, loud, joyful, full of passion, short. “Blessed is the King!” they yelled, throwing their garments on the ground for His donkey to walk over. Not long after, the crowds would cry something different: “Crucify Him!”\nBut it seems that Jesus gave a legato response to the crowd: long notes, connected to a deeper understanding of His purpose. His statements reference the Old Testament: “the stones will cry out” from Habakkuk 2; and “For the days will come on you when your enemies will build a barricade around you, surround you, and hem you in on every side” (Luke 19:43), from Isaiah 29, Jeremiah 6, and Ezekiel 4.\nJesus’s statement, “If you knew this day what would bring peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes” resounds with wisdom and sadness (Luke 19:42). He was speaking to Jerusalem, the city He loved. He was speaking to the crowds who cheered Him and the Pharisees who challenged Him. He spoke with authority, which would quickly be followed up with anger when He cleansed the temple. \nLent, Holy Week, and Easter are a symphony, full of staccato celebration and legato mourning. We cheer, we cry. We celebrate, we abstain. We experience the fullness of life, death, and hope everlasting. We are Easter people, but we have the whole of the story in our bones. And every time we read it, we feel it more and deeper: the pain, the joy, and the glorious hope.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nWhy is Jesus looking for figs out of season? I’m not mad when I can’t get a good red strawberry in March—they are just out of season and I’ll have to wait. No hard feelings, you juicy little strawberries! We’ll meet again in summer. But Jesus sees the fig tree advertising with some glorious fiddle-y leaves and He assumes that those leaves promise fruit. Alas, the promise of fruit on this tree is an empty one. \nOkay, could we still be on good terms with a strawberry plant even if she were adorned in dark, waxy green leaves in early spring? Yup. No problem. I’d likely think it was strange, share the protein bar packed in my pocket with companions, and keep on hiking. So why was Jesus so disappointed in the fig tree, even angry at it? \nIf you read the immediately following verses, the judgment of the fig tree is a direct parallel to the judgment of the temple. In each case, God’s wrath is visited upon self-righteous hypocrisy, on those who feign life, but are empty of it. The appearance and the substance were in conflict; just like the temple in Jerusalem, it had the show of fruitfulness but was in fact barren.\nWe are all prone to boast good things, but less prone to deliver. And Jesus has our number: “You’ll recognize them by their fruit” (Matthew 7:16). Just as we ought to hunger and thirst after righteousness, so Christ as our Lord, hungers and thirsts to see righteousness borne out in our lives (Matthew 5:6). It is the fruit He is looking for. To find instead a vain and hypocritical show of faith, a surface religion, a pretended devotion, and hidden behind it a false and worldly heart, is an affront to His Lordship.\nThis is also a destructive act from the hand of Jesus, which is telling, as it should signify to us that which most stirs His righteous anger. The temple of our hearts is to be full of prayer, full of His Word, full of the Spirit of Christ. The temple of our hearts can too easily become a den of thievery, stealing the benefits of the gospel for our own gain, a showy righteousness that draws the applause of men, the lining of our own pockets, and the preening of our own pride. \nWe can look gorgeously leafy from afar, yet up close we are shrivelled and dry. But He is our spring of hope. With Him, our fruit looks like worship, obedience, and prayer. We ought to be full of juicy, bright fruit for the Lord. Whether we’re feeling like dry husks or like new blossoms, we don’t have to produce fruit out of thin air. Jesus is our source of life.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Guest Writer\n\nHaunting images flashed before my eyes following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Burned into my memory is the image of a huge, steel cross that was found amidst the rubble of the collapsed World Trade Center in New York City. I’ll never forget the image of smoke and dust swirling around the scorched cross standing like a beacon in the midst of the debris, as rescue workers searched for survivors buried in the ruins. \nSimilar violence would have haunted the Jewish people who gathered around Jesus at the temple. Throughout this Lenten season we have grappled with Jeremiah’s prophecy of judgment and destruction that became reality when the Babylonian army invaded Jerusalem and demolished Solomon’s Temple in 586 BC. The very ground under Jesus’s feet had been battered and covered in rubble when the first temple’s walls fell. \nHundreds of years later, Jesus stood and taught on the same site surrounded by an opulent new temple, and He predicted that destruction would come again. “These things that you see—the days will come when not one stone will be left on another that will not be thrown down” (Luke 21:6). Herod the Great had spared no expense in renovating and expanding the temple. Despite the structure’s significance, size, and grandeur, the ground shook and the walls fell again when Rome conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the second temple in 70 AD. Jesus’s listeners couldn’t escape the images of wreckage and neither can we. \nDuring Lent, we pause and sit in the rubble. We choke on the smoke swirling from the sins and sorrows of the world. Natural disasters, wars, illnesses, and violence of all sorts bombard the globe. The dust stirred up by our own wrongdoing chokes us as well. Selfishness, pride, greed, envy, rage, and unbelief wage war within us every day. The cross of ashes smeared on many foreheads at the beginning of Lent symbolizes our lament as a people scorched by sin and sorrow and who need deliverance. \nThere is a scorched cross standing like a beacon for us too. The construction worker who found the steel cross after 9/11, Frank Silecchia, said, “I saw Calvary in the midst of all the wreckage… It was a sign… that God didn’t desert us.” Jesus has not left us in the wreckage of sin. He came to us, lived a sinless life, yet was persecuted and died on a cross like a criminal to pay for our unfaithfulness and mend our brokenness. He was battered and absorbed the attack that would have destroyed us all.\nScripture tells us that when Jesus died “the earth quaked, and the rocks were split” (Matthew 27:51). Walls fell down again. But this time, it was the walls of sin and sorrow that were demolished. The impenetrable walls that had separated a sinful people from a holy God were in ruins. By rising from the rubble, Jesus conquered death, allowing all who believe in Him to be saved and to live forever in peace with Him. This is our hope in a sin-scorched world: Jesus has come and He will come again.\n\nPatti Sauls lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband Scott and daughters, Abby and Ellie, where they serve alongside the people of Christ Presbyterian Church. Prior to living in Nashville, the Sauls planted churches in Kansas City and Saint Louis and served at New York City’s Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitie Stoddard\n\nGrowing up with two brothers, there were times I felt a little outnumbered. Once, I came home from dance class to find my favorite doll held hostage in a game of cops and robbers. Shrieking, I dodged foam darts to rescue her from the basement war zone. I sulked away, dreaming of ways to avenge my doll’s honor. I was in no mood to share.\nAs an adult, the things we hold most dear might be our family, time, or resources. But when someone tries to lay a hand on our precious commodities, you’d better believe we can still throw a toddler-sized tantrum. Our fists close tighter and tighter around the stuff that gives our lives meaning, and we lose sight of the only one who can bring true meaning to our lives.\nThere are many accounts throughout the Bible where God asks people to loosen their grip for the sake of the gospel. One such story is found when God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac (Genesis 22). We can all immediately recognize the costliness of being asked to give up a child. Abraham obeyed even that most painful instruction because he trusted God. Ultimately the Lord spared Isaac and provided a lamb for sacrifice, painting the illustration of things to come. God would give up His own perfect Son as the Lamb on our behalf. In doing so, God Himself paid the price we deserved. \nWhile many of us struggle to hand over our idols when pressed, there are some followers of Jesus who freely give without even being asked. Mary of Bethany (according to John 12:2–3) was one such saint. Nobody guilted her into an offering, and yet she took what was probably the most expensive thing she owned, a vat of perfume, and lavishly broke it over the head of the Messiah. The Pharisees criticized her generosity, feigning concern for the poor, but Jesus saw through their calculating hearts.\nChrist praised Mary’s extravagant gift, saying her act will forever be “told in memory of her” (Mark 14:9). Mary chose to live open-handedly, and it was counted as eternally significant. She gave away treasures on earth to store up treasures in heaven (Matthew 6:19–21). And in doing so, she built a legacy that mattered. Before Mary even walked the earth, her actions were affirmed in the wisdom writings: “A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of one’s death is better than the day of one’s birth” (Ecclesiastes 7:1). \nBoth Mary and Abraham earned good names for themselves by living as one anointed for death. We, too, are called to live anointed for death. Jesus said that if we want to follow Him, we must die to ourselves and take up our crosses (Matthew 16:24). As Christians, that means we must loosen our grip on earthly things and focus our eyes on heavenly things. \nWhen we think about the impact we want to have in our lifetimes, let’s remember Mary of Bethany, who poured out her gifts for the ultimate gift giver. By dying to ourselves and joining with Christ in His anointing for burial, we are covered in the perfume of grace. Then our legacy will become a fragrant offering of Christ to the world (2 Corinthians 2:15).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nMy good friend had hit a breaking point. After experiencing crisis upon crisis, she finally collapsed under the weight of what felt like too much to bear. A relationship had just dissolved. An EF-3 tornado ripped through her neighborhood, and she spent the next week volunteering with Hands-On Nashville relief efforts. There are financial struggles within her family. The COVID-19 quarantine suspended her classes and, along with it, the chance of getting into a music program for which she had already had four callbacks. In a moment of clarity, she realized while texting us that her birthday was that coming weekend—a birthday she would likely not be able to celebrate as planned.\nMy friend’s sorrows are personal, but she is not alone in her grief. Similar sorrows are shared by much of the world right now. There is a collective weight in the air these days. Can you imagine the sorrow Jesus must have carried during the nights leading up to His death? He had His own sorrow (Mark 14:34), but He ached for His friends as well (Luke 22:32), even as He prepared to carry the sin and sorrow of the whole world on His shoulders (Isaiah 53:4). \nDuring the Passover feast with His disciples—what we call the Last Supper—Jesus knows that sorrow will soon find them. Trying to prepare His friends for His death, He navigates the situation with delicacy and affirms the sorrow they will feel in losing Him, a close friend. He also reassures them that it will be worth it in the end. “You will become sorrowful,” He says, “but your sorrow will turn to joy” (John 16:20). This strange comfort is also for women who suffer the pain of childbirth (v.21) or Christian martyrs facing their own death after standing for a cause. \nSorrow isn’t a bad thing. Jesus experienced it as a natural part of the human condition. But even while affirming such feelings, He gives the disciples a framework for understanding their future hope—a future extending far beyond the plane of what they can immediately see. Yes, they must grieve His death, but that death was actually a seed that would unfold into new life. Jesus makes sure His disciples know with certainty that they will see Him again (v.22). Even if they don’t fully understand what He means, this changes everything for them, just as it changes everything for us.\nNo matter what happens in this life, we will see Jesus again. Because of the resurrection, those who hope in Christ Jesus will see each other again too. There is a time coming when every tear will be wiped away, and the burdens that we carry will be released (Revelation 21:4). The old will pass away, as joy triumphs over our troubles and swallows the pain of grief. \nIn Christ, we have permission to feel sorrow. But we also have the charge to walk forward in courage and expectation of our future hope. “You will have suffering in this world,” Jesus tells us. “Be courageous! I have conquered the world” (John 16:33). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nWhy did they crucify Jesus? Because it was a part of God’s eternal redemptive plan, for starters, but what did they write down in their court records? What was His crime? He was King of the Jews.\nJesus attests to this identity, as does Pilate, and later, the Roman soldiers. The magi came to Bethlehem, seeking Him by this title, and it was the written charge against Him as He hung on the cross (Matthew 27:37). He wasn’t the king the Jewish people expected, nor was He the king they wanted. When “Pilate asked him, ‘Are you the King of the Jews?’ He answered him, ‘You say so’” (Mark 15:2). He made no defense because it was His very person that offended, His Kingship itself is an offense to every sinful heart. The Cornerstone is the stumbling block, the rock of offense. They mocked Him as He hung on the cross, but their tongues unwittingly confessed Him as “Messiah, the King of Israel.”\nIn his letter to the Romans, the indictment that Paul brings against unbelievers is not that they do not know the truth, but that they know it, and yet suppress it: “For God’s wrath is revealed from heaven against all godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth” (Romans 1:18). Though He came to humanity in flesh and blood, “he was despised, and we didn’t value him” (Isaiah 53:3).\nPilate and the Jewish people did not need more evidence of who Jesus was in order to believe. They rejected the evidence that was right in front of them. Indeed, when at the end “Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed his last,” even this testified to who He is in such a way that when the centurion witnessed His death, the soldier said, ‘“Truly this man was the Son of God!’” (Mark 15:37,39).\nEach Lenten season, the Church remembers the long journey Christ walked to the cross. Each year, we encounter the same evidence, the same professions of Jesus’s Messiahship, the same hardened hearts that do not like the truth before them. The goodness of Good Friday is that Christ came to redeem blind, deaf, and rebellious people just like us. He came to bear upon Himself the guilt of our sin:\n“He was pierced because of our rebellion, crushed because of our iniquities; punishment for our peace was on him, and we are healed by his wounds” (Isaiah 53:5).\nThe goodness of Good Friday is that because He walked silently to the cross, like a Lamb to slaughter, not protesting the punishment meted out upon Him, we have hope. He was rejected by God that we might be made acceptable to God, a people for His own possession. This was the promise given through Jeremiah: “I will be their God, and they will be my people” (Jeremiah 31:33). See as the centurion did, the truth that is already before our eyes, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and He has purchased our salvation! Thanks be to God!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\n“I cannot even begin to imagine.”\nIt’s a response I’ve gotten used to as someone who writes about grief and feels it often. It’s all said with good intentions, of course, a nod to the gravity of the situation, but mostly, what I want to say in return is, “Yes, of course you can.” This life hurts, certainly we have all felt that. \nThere’s peripheral grief, the pain we find in tweets and headlines, feeling the loss of someone we once knew or will never meet. It’s the kind we pass through like a hospital hallway, guilty to be leaving so obviously whole, and yet, so unmistakably broken. \nThere’s nearby grief, sympathy pangs for the people we love and would trade places with in an instant. If only it could be us, we could tend to our own wounds and know exactly where it hurt. But instead, we visit, we sit, we wait, we do our best. \nThen there’s intimate grief, the deep aches that shape us and never leave us the same. This kind ushers us into an entirely new reality, where we wonder if we’ll ever find joy again. And at the same time, we also question if we’d even want to, if we deserve to. \nHoly Saturday—the day between Jesus’s crucifixion and resurrection—invites us into all three dimensions of grief, a display of just how heartbreaking this life can be. After Jesus’s death, we see the silent doubts of onlookers in the crowd, feel the loss experienced by His closest disciples, and intimately grieve Our Father’s separation from His Son. With all of this obvious pain, it’s no wonder we’re hesitant to believe the good-news promises that have been made to us. And yet, here’s the most important part of today’s reading: \nThe next day, which followed the preparation day, the chief priests  and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said,  “Sir, we remember that while this deceiver was still alive he said,  ‘After three days I will rise again.’ So give orders that the tomb be made secure  until the third day” (Matthew 27:62–64).\nAlthough the scene was full of grief and doubt, the tomb was still secured by guards. While they said they were afraid His followers would steal His body, part of me wants to believe there’s a bigger truth at play here: Even those who opposed Jesus believed there was a chance He would keep His promises. \nRegardless of whether we feel grief coming at us from all sides, or we don’t feel able to believe that God is who He says He is, the resurrection still comes. Easter still happens. Jesus offers the kind of mercy I cannot even begin to imagine or understand. Thanks be to God, whose faithfulness is good and whose promises are true. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\nBY Erin Davis\n\nSpiritually speaking, we’re all olms. \nOlms are salamanders that live deep in the caves of Croatia. Because their days are spent in total darkness, they have no need to see. After spending generations away from the light, their eyes have become covered by layers of pink skin, rendering the olms blind.\nAs we read the account of Resurrection Sunday, the people mentioned move into the background. Our minds want to focus on Jesus, our resurrected Savior. But for the reality of the resurrection to have its full effect on our hearts, we also need to consider the ones who were too blind to see that their risen Lord was standing right in front of them. \nTake a second look at the apostles. Jesus Himself had told them He would not stay dead (John 2:18–22; Matthew 12:39–40; 16:21). And yet when they first heard that He had risen—just as He promised He would—the words of the women who’d reported the news to them “seemed like nonsense… and they did not believe the women” (Luke 24:11). \nThen there are Cleopas and another unnamed disciple, who literally walked alongside the risen Jesus on the road to Emmaus but “were prevented from recognizing him” (Luke 24:16). They’d dismissed the possibility of His resurrection, and even explained the events of His own death to Him. I imagine they sighed as they looked into the face of their risen Redeemer and told Him, “We were hoping that he was the one who was about to redeem Israel” (v.21). After they’d finished eating dinner with Jesus, “their eyes were opened and they recognized him,” and then He “disappeared from their sight” (v.31). And when Jesus again appeared to eleven of His closest friends, “They were startled and terrified and thought they were seeing a ghost” (v.37). \nCave salamanders—every single one of them. \nJesus appeared before them in His glorified body. He walked beside them on the road, stood in their midst face to face, and yet they simply could not see the truth about who He was. This is a picture of our true spiritual condition. Living with sin, generation after generation, has blinded us. On our own, we do not recognize our desperate need for the light of our Savior. Faith has become unnatural to us.\nYet, God has mercifully called us out of darkness and into His marvelous light (1Peter 2:9). He has given us eyes to see that the resurrection is not a fairy tale, and it is more than a historical event. God has gifted us the faith to believe that this is the moment that Jesus defeated death, so that we may be made alive in Him. \nJesus is real. He is risen. He is returning. Thank God! If you can peer into the empty tomb found in Scripture this Lenten season, and declare, “He is not here. For he has risen, just as he said” (Matthew 28:6), praise Jesus that He fulfills His promises. And then repeat the words of the blind man who was given sight, “One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I can see!” (John 9:25). \nAs you bask in the hope granted us on resurrection morning, consider anew the deep darkness Jesus saved you from, and celebrate the incomprehensible truth of what Christ’s resurrection really means for us: we have been remade, from salamanders to saints, and brought from darkness into His eternal light.\n\n",
