    "devo_summary": "\n\nThere are two chief mistakes we can make when we read the promises of God, and they are equally dangerous. The first is to assume that every promise can be lifted from the pages of Scripture and applied directly to our lives. The other is to believe that nearly all of the promises came and went in the ancient world—that the only one meant for us today is the promise of eternal life we receive when we place our trust in Christ. Neither approach is biblical, though, for Scripture says that, “no matter how many promises God has made, they are ‘Yes’ in Christ” (2Corinthians 1:20 NIV). \n\nAnd of course they are! How else would the plans of our “compassionate and gracious God” work (Exodus 34:6)? When every story in the Old Testament points forward to the coming of the Son of God, and every word in the New Testament is a response to His life and work, we should not be surprised to find that every promise is indeed “Yes” in Christ. \n\nNot only that, but all the promises in the Old Testament—the ones we thought were surely over and done with, or meant only for ethnic Israel—are transformed and enlarged in the wake of Christ’s ministry. In many cases, the New Testament writers help us see the way these promises are renewed in Christ. In this way, learning about the promises of God becomes a means of deepening our understanding of Christ and His work, and an occasion to worship our great Savior.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nAs the story of the Bible opens, we encounter human failure at every turn. Adam and Eve invite sin and death into our world. Cain kills Abel, even after God warns him about the evil lurking in his heart. And there’s nearly everyone else—“every inclination of the human mind was nothing but evil all the time” (Genesis 6:5). Who could blame God if He had decided enough was enough? But in Genesis 12, God does something tremendously gracious: He chooses to befriend an elderly man from Mesopotamia and bless him beyond all imagination. \n\nThe promises God made to Abram, later renamed Abraham, seem too big for reality: descendants enough to replace the stars in the sky, with kings among their number; a name known far and wide; and a piece of real estate approximately the size of New Hampshire. These promises seem so removed from our everyday lives that we tend to leave them in the past, there among the tents and flocks of Abraham and Sarah. But the New Testament tells us that these promises are actually ours in Christ. \n\nWe are counted among the stars in the sky Abraham saw, heirs of the blessings bestowed upon the patriarch in response to his faith (Galatians 3:29). Abraham is our father by the way of the promise, just as he was Isaac’s (Romans 4:17). We are even “kings,” since we have been given a royal priesthood (Genesis 17:6; 1 Peter 2:9). And the land? That may be the best part. In Christ, that promise has been transformed, stretched out, and enlarged. It now encompasses the whole earth (Romans 4:13), including the city of New Jerusalem where we will one day live with God, just as Adam and Eve did so many years ago in Eden (Hebrews 11:16; Revelation 21:2–3). In God’s promises to Abraham, Christ has transformed our failures into blessings, not because we deserve it, but because He is just that good. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhat must it have been like to receive instructions directly from the mouth of the Lord? “Now you and all the people prepare to cross over the Jordan to the land I am giving the Israelites,” God told Joshua (Joshua 1:2). Moses had died, and now it was Joshua’s turn to lead—not because Joshua said so, but because God had said so. \n\nScripture does not describe Joshua’s emotional reaction to God’s directive, but we can infer from what God said next that Joshua was less than confident about the enormous task ahead of him: “I will be with you, just as I was with Moses. I will not leave you or abandon you” (Joshua 1:5). Put yourself in Joshua’s place, the weight of a nation’s survival on your shoulders and impossible battles before you. Let God’s promise sink in.\n\nGod was indeed with Joshua. In the chapters that follow, we see Joshua successfully lead the Israelite people across the Jordan accompanied by none other than the tangible presence of God with the ark of the covenant. And we see God fight for Israel as they take possession of the promised land under Joshua’s command. Everyone who followed Joshua benefited from God’s presence.\n\nBut Joshua’s life and mission point to someone greater: Jesus Christ. And just as God’s promise to Joshua was for the benefit of all those who followed and obeyed Joshua, the promise is extended today to all those who follow and obey Jesus. The Lord’s presence is with us, wherever Christ leads. We can, therefore, rejoice in the freedom from fear that is ours in Christ. “The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?” (Hebrews 13:6).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nIn Jesus’s day, it was in the air—a collective desire that nearly everyone in Judea and Galilee felt. A thousand years had passed since God had made a promise to David, and it was the sort of promise that was only held onto because it had come from God Himself: “Your house and kingdom will endure before me forever, and your throne will be established forever” (2Samuel 7:16). \n\nIt certainly didn’t look like one of David’s descendants was poised to resurrect his father’s kingdom any time soon. Rome held the land and its people tightly. In fact, it was treason to speak of another king besides Caesar. Yet when Jesus began His public ministry, the coming kingdom was central to His message—only Jesus spoke of the kingdom as belonging not merely to David, but to God. \n\nJesus is the King who sits on David’s throne, but more than that, He sits at the right hand of the Father. And His kingdom is not limited to the land of Israel; it spreads across the whole earth as the gospel is preached and received, until one day when it will be said, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” (Revelation 11:15). \n\nThose of us who know Jesus as Lord also know the kingdom as the home we long for. In Christ, we are now its citizens (Philippians 3:20), and when He returns, we will reign with Him (2Timothy 2:12). Until that day comes, we join with David and every other faithful soul throughout history who has ached with longing for the promised kingdom.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nToo good to be true. The promise of Jeremiah 29:11 can feel just too good to be true. Often spoken over another person as an encouragement to combat a disappointment or setback, the words can ring hollow when understood in their original context. That’s because God wasn’t talking about career success, dating relationships, or winning the JV soccer game. And He wasn’t addressing anyone and everyone. He was talking specifically to the people of Judah in exile. The “plans” God had involved restoring them as a nation and bringing them back from Babylon into the promised land. So unless you happen to be a sixth-century-BC Jew stuck in Mesopotamia for the duration, keep on moving—there’s nothing to see here.\n\nIn one sense, this is true. It won’t do to simply pick up a promise meant for someone else and take hold of it for ourselves or someone we love. But God has grafted all believers into His family tree of God (Ephesians 1:4–5; see also Romans 11:17). So the “future” God promised to His people in the Old Testament is now ours in Christ if we know Him, and the “hope” is bigger and better than anything we can imagine, because it is the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27), of eternal life in the presence of the King (2Peter 1:4; Revelation 21:3), and of all things being made new (Revelation 21:5). \n\nWhen faced with life’s challenges, the promise we have in Jeremiah is not that everything will work out the way we want, but instead that Christ will bring good from even the darkest moments this world can dish out. And in that, there is something lasting to hold onto. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nHad you been chosen as an Old Testament prophet, you would have had the unpopular job of giving people bad news. Judgment, punishment, destruction—these were the sort of words you might have become known for using. Sure, you would have also used their redemptive counterparts, like restoration and salvation, but often only after all the judgment, punishment, and destruction talk. When Jesus came along, He spoke words of warning like the prophets before Him, but He also offered forgiveness in a way that they, not being God in the flesh, could not. “For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him” (John 3:17).\n\nWhile some people were drawn to Jesus, many were offended by His words and actions. Scribes accused Him of blasphemy for telling a paralytic man his sins were forgiven (Mark 2:5–7). Pharisees were appalled that He let a notoriously sinful woman touch Him (Luke 7:39). Why did Jesus say these things and spend time with these people? \n\nJesus knew the Father’s heart, a heart that aches for sinners limping through this world under the weight of rebellion and brokenness. It had been His plan from the beginning to provide a way for sins to be forgiven. That way is Jesus. No matter how dark or scandalous our personal sins may be, God extends mercy to us—and to the entire world—because of the price Jesus paid on the cross. He laid down His life to secure pardon for every repentant sinner. \n\n",

Maybe you just imagine a morning when you get to ignore the alarm and sleep for an extra thirty minutes. The image we often have of rest is one of stillness and quiet, but what Jesus promises us goes beyond mere tranquility.\n\nThe rest Jesus offers isn’t a retreat, but a new way of living, drawn from an Old Testament concept called shalom. Shalom is more than rest; it is peace, wholeness, blessing, and connection to the Lord. This is only possible when we learn to rely on God rather than our own efforts, to cast our worries onto His back rather than piling them up on our own. This is the rest Jesus calls us to. And when we accept His invitation, we find His peace that surpasses all understanding (Philippians 4:7). \n\nJesus tells His followers that His “yoke is easy and [His] burden is light” (Matthew 11:30). His “yoke” is a lifestyle, a commitment to walk in obedience to His teachings and in light of His example. Jesus taught the way of the kingdom, complete with the pace and priorities of heaven, and He modeled total dependence on God, the key to true shalom. When we follow His example, we learn we can take His peace with us wherever we go. \n\n",

A foreign invader in this world, death is out of place and unwelcome. This is why we mourn at a funeral—because funerals were never meant to be. In the Old Testament, King David trusted the Lord to rescue his soul from the grave, resting in the hope that in the life after death, he would find himself in the presence of God, where there is “abundant joy” (Psalm 16:11). \n\nBut the hope of the Christian life is not only life after death; it’s much more than that. Yes, Jesus promised His followers eternal life, but He also spoke of a new life that starts right here and now. It is life with God, and it is eternal because God is eternal. Praying to the Father, Jesus said, “This is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and the one you have sent—Jesus Christ” (John 17:3).\n\nThis promised life is abundant life (John 10:10). And how could it not be? David was right when he wrote that there is joy in the presence of God. Through the Holy Spirit, we carry that presence with us wherever we go. Life is not easy, but we can be joyful no matter what happens, because God is with us. Whether we die before the Lord returns or are caught up to meet Him in the air when He does (1Thessalonians 4:17), the life we have in Christ will continue. “Where, death, is your sting?” (1Corinthians 15:55).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhen we think about God’s promises, we tend to focus on the blessings: forgiveness, mercy, and eternal life, to name a few. But Jesus promised us something else as well: “You will have suffering in this world” (John 16:33). Read that again. That’s not You might or You may or You could. It’s You will. As sure as death and taxes and God’s love for sinners, we will suffer—Jesus guarantees it.\n\nFor many people, God and suffering are not compatible. If God exists, they reason, then there should be no suffering, for how could a good God allow it? But the true God is no stranger to pain. The Son allowed His body to be tormented and twisted by the most gruesome torture device of the ancient world, the cross. And He did so to put an end to the world’s suffering, once and for all. In the same breath that He promised us suffering, He made another promise, one so sure that it was spoken in the past tense: “I have conquered the world” (John 16:33). \n\nSin has so wormed itself in and through this world that we cannot avoid suffering entirely. It would be like trying to avoid sand at the beach. But we also suffer in a special way as Christ’s followers. We suffer because He suffered first. And when we endure this life and all it can throw at us, the same way He did, we display our faith that Christ has indeed conquered the world. For “if we died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him” (2Timothy 2:11–12).\n\n",

But that perfect fellowship was revoked when sin entered the picture, carving a deep, uncrossable chasm between fallen humanity and the holy Creator. Even still, “God with us” echoes throughout Scripture. The Lord appeared to men like Abraham and Moses. His presence filled the tabernacle and, later, the temple. And, of course, we have the prophets, who proclaimed that a Messiah would come to save us, forever restoring our relationship with the Lord (Isaiah 7:14). \n\nHe came just as the prophets foretold. Jesus was born Immanuel, the name that means “God with us” (Matthew 1:23). He is God incarnate, fully God and fully man, who walked among His people and brought the kingdom of heaven to earth. He is the Word made flesh—the living, breathing fulfillment of the promise who both restores and secures our fellowship with God for eternity (John 1:14). \n\nJesus’s disciples experienced the tangible presence of God with them, walking and talking in their midst. But the gift Jesus gave before ascending into heaven to sit at the Father’s right hand is the same gift He gives to us (John 14:26; 20:22). The Spirit of the living Christ dwells in all who have been saved by grace through faith in Him. He is with us—right here, right now, always (Matthew 28:20). Better still, we will one day experience that same joyful fellowship Adam and Eve knew in the garden; we, too, will live with God in a perfect, pain-free world of His creation. Jesus Himself is preparing a place for us, and He will call us there one glorious day. “Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!” (John 14:3; Revelation 22:20).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nThe word gospel simply means “good news,” but sometimes it can be difficult to fathom just how good the news really is. The gift of God is not only the forgiveness of sins, nor is the gift just everlasting life on a renewed earth, free from sin, death, and pain. God goes further than that: He brings us into His family, with all the rights and privileges that come with being a child of the King (Galatians 4:7).\n\nGod’s Word says, “He has also raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus” (Ephesians 2:6). Notice that this is our current status. According to this verse, we have already been raised up to take our place beside the Lord. We are God’s children, so we have a seat with the family, right next to Jesus. But that’s not all. We are there for a reason: “so that in the coming ages he might display the immeasurable riches of his grace through his kindness to us in Christ Jesus” (Ephesians 2:7).\n\nHow could we even begin to calculate or imagine what an infinite God might mean by “immeasurable riches”? Peter described them as “imperishable, undefiled, and unfading,” and “kept in heaven for you” (1Peter 1:4). We will need to wait for these. But there is a greater gift still, and it is ours right now: God Himself. “And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, ‘Abba, Father!’” (Galatians 4:6). We get to call the Maker of heaven and earth Abba, the same intimate and familiar term Jesus used of the Father (Mark 14:36). Calling this news “good” doesn’t seem to quite do it justice.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWe’ve all tasted the sweet relief that comes with a bit of freedom. But there is a world of difference between the temporary freedom of summer vacation and the eternal freedom we have in the kingdom of God. In the Gospel of John, Jesus proclaims that “if the Son sets you free, you really will be free” (John 8:36). Those listening to Him were undoubtedly confused. In offering freedom, Jesus was implying they were somehow slaves, but they weren’t enslaved to anyone, not legally or physically anyway. How can you be set free if you aren’t in chains?\n\nApart from Christ, we are bound to our sin. This was true of the people in Jesus’s day, and it’s true of us now. Scripture is saturated with references to what life apart from Christ looks like. We were once slaves to sin (John 8:34) and ruled by death (Romans 6:9). Sin reigned in our bodies (Romans 6:12), and we stood condemned (Romans 8:2). But Jesus went to battle for us against the powers of darkness and came out victorious. His promise of freedom is a timeless one meant for anyone who comes to Christ. It doesn’t elapse or depend on our own merit. If the Son frees you, then you are free.\n\nOur invitation into God’s family is an invitation into an abundant life that is no longer bent low under the weight of sin. It’s an invitation into an eternal way of being, one where our sin is uprooted and cast as far as the east is from the west (Psalm 103:12). It is an invitation to freedom.\n\n",

But with the first temptation, our relationship with God’s provision has changed. The serpent convinced Adam and Eve that God was holding out on us, that it might be better if we provided for ourselves (Genesis 3:4–5). And that lie has governed much of our behavior ever since. We may still want God’s gifts, but in our sin, we want them on our own terms.\n\nWhen Jesus came, He modeled dependence on God, forsaking worry and the cares of this world for a life of contentment and abundance. He spoke truth to break the devil’s ancient lie, declaring that whatever we may build for ourselves on earth will crumble in the end; only that which is eternal—what is stored up in heaven—will last (Matthew 6:19–20). And He reminded people what had always been true: that “every good and perfect gift is from above” (James 1:17). God feeds the birds and clothes the flowers of the field, and we are much more valuable than these (Matthew 6:25–34). But greater than any gift from the Father’s hand is the Father Himself. As long as we have Him, we can have joy, for He is enough (Philippians 4:12–13).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nThe kingdom promise of a glorious resurrection can be a confusing one. It is hard to imagine a world where believers are raised in glory and power—their natural, earthly bodies having been transformed (1Corinthians 15:40, 42–44). The promise of glory stands in contrast to just about everything that we experience on a day-to-day basis here on earth.\n\nThe natural bodies that will be transformed in the final resurrection are the same bodies that endure all sorts of affliction here on earth. Similar to God’s promise to make everything new, His promise to make us glorious is the reimagination of biological life itself—a body without pain or hardship (Revelation 21). Inherent in this promise is an acknowledgement of the physical struggles we often experience on earth and a reminder that the pain and fatigue we experience will not last forever. The bodies of believers in this life battle sickness, heartache, and brokenness; in the new heaven and new earth, those things will be no more. Our bodies will “bear the image of the man of heaven” (1Corinthians 15:49), Jesus Christ. We will shine “like the stars” (Daniel 12:3), taking on a measure of beauty beyond what is possible in this age.\n\nLiving with this promise in view is an example of what it looks like to experience the already-not-yet nature of God’s kingdom. We have already been given the glory of having the Spirit of God reside within us (Ephesians 1:14), but have not yet experienced the glory of the new bodies we will one day inherit. That day may seem far off, but because of Christ, it is also a guarantee.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nThe best stories end with good triumphing over evil, the hero saving the day, and peace being restored to the land. But the story we are living will have a greater ending still. God promises to make all things new and to bring goodness from every broken and twisted thing. How this will happen is largely a mystery. In the midst of this world breaking and twisting around us, the heartache and sorrow we experience doesn’t seem to contain even a spark of goodness to be fanned into flame. So this, of all God’s promises, may require the greatest amount of faith.\n\nThe Bible does give us a glimpse into the final outcome: a world where God dwells with His people and “grief, crying, and pain will be no more” (Revelation 21:3–4). That God could take the murder and theft and lies of this world and transform it all into a place that feels like heaven is beyond our ability to comprehend. And yet, we see it in the cross. The most broken and twisted thing imaginable—the murder of the Son of God—became the greatest good thing the world has ever known.\n\nThrough the cross, God has made a way for His goodness to permeate our world and overtake the curse we all live under. Every pain and hardship we suffer is being worked “together for the good of those who love God, who are called according to his purpose” (Romans 8:28). Though we cannot fathom how it will be done, we can trust that it will be, because we can trust the One who has made this promise. All of the promises of God found in His Word are as certain as He is good. He is the reason for our hope, and the hope of the Lord does not disappoint (Romans 5:5).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Raechel Myers\n\nEver doubt your salvation?\n\nI think I’ve got it right, but what if I’m wrong? I know the gospel story, but do I really understand it?I believe Jesus was who He said He was, but what does it mean for my life today?\n\nIf you and I are asking these questions now, imagine how early Christendom must have wrestled with the newness of the gospel message—a message that stood contrary to any attempt to earn salvation through the accumulation of knowledge and wisdom.\n\nJohn wrote three relatively short letters to assure the world then, and us now, that salvation is from God: the gospel is true. John’s Gospel is the historical, theological record of Christ’s life on earth, and his letters are the pastoral communication of the significance of Christ’s life. They build on what we already know. John begins by using four words we honestly need to hear from him:\n\nHeard. Seen. Observed. Touched. \n\nWe need to hear them because they are sensory, tangible. They communicate real events that were physically witnessed by many, including John himself. In short, they are “proofs” of the gospel. \n\nYou see, John was actually there for the Sermon on the Mount. He was there to hear Jesus’s own voice tell the parable of the prodigal son, and declare, “Before Abraham was, I Am” (John 8:58). John could still remember the sting of Christ’s rebuke about who should sit at His side in the coming kingdom. And “Here is your mother,” are words John would likely never forget hearing Jesus breathe out to him from the cross (John 19:27). John watched Jesus walk across the Sea of Galilee, and he was on the scene to partake in the institution of the Lord’s Supper. \n\nHeard. Seen. Observed. Touched. \n\nJohn begins by assuring us that his Gospel account (the book of John) is true. Then, he invites us down a path of holy concern to examine whether the message of the gospel has actually changed our lives. \n\nDo you say you have fellowship with Christ, but walk in darkness? Or do you have real, in-the-light fellowship with the Savior of the world?\n\nDo you say you have no sin? Or do you actively confess your sin, believing Christ is able and sufficient to cleanse you and bring you into the light? \n\nDo you fear the light? Prefer the darkness? Or do you live a life that combats darkness, seeking and shining?\n\nThese aren’t rhetorical questions. Let’s actually take some time today—real time—to ask ourselves and the Lord if we are actively struggling with darkness. The struggle itself is not sin. Ask any seasoned believer and they will testify to this truth: the Lord is always working in our hearts to bring light (Philippians 1:6). As long as we are on earth, there will always be darkness to drive out. And as long as we have breath in our lungs, the process of sanctification will be present. If we are not actively struggling with darkness, it isn’t because there is no darkness in our lives. It is because that darkness has become comfortable. The Christian life—the life of salvation through the gospel of Christ Jesus—is a life that will constantly battle the darkness until Perfection comes. \n\nJohn’s letters are written to assure us of our faith. But like any excellent pastor, he writes both to comfort the afflicted, and to afflict the comfortable. He delivers the healing balm of the gospel message, but that message calls for an ongoing death to self that is anything but comfortable (1Peter 2:24).\n\nAre you comfortable today, when perhaps there is darkness in and around you that you need to see? Let the Word of God bring about holy affliction, a conviction of sin and complacency that draws you closer to Him. \n\nLord, afflict us with your Truth, that we may be comforted. Shine light in our dark places. Let us never stop pursuing holiness. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\nI have a habit of romanticizing the morning.\n\nIn my mind, the perfect morning looks like this: Rising before the sun and the dogs and the kids. Drinking a fresh cup of French-pressed coffee by lamplight while the house is still and dark. Enjoying uninterrupted quiet while the sun inches over the horizon, my Bible open and my knees bent in prayer. Feeling filled up and ready by the time the light streams bright through the windows and four sets of little feet tromp down the stairs. \n\nIn reality, I’m so immune to my alarm that I have to change the tune weekly just so I won’t ignore it. Quiet time rarely happens in the quiet, and my coffee almost always grows cold during the mildly organized chaos of our current morning routine. That early light that streams into the dining room is my favorite of the day in theory, but actually sitting down at the table first thing in the morning can nearly blind a girl. \n\nIn my imagination, mornings are smooth and peaceful. In reality, they are a battle. I think this is, in part, what John wants his readers to see: the Christian life is beautiful, but it is also a battle. Light and darkness are always at odds, and we can expect to be involved in the clash.\n\nBut John’s message is not one of despair. On the contrary, it is one of confidence and bold encouragement. The light of Christ is already shining, and the darkness has no choice but to retreat in its wake. The presence of darkness in our world, and even in our hearts, is not something we have to muster up the strength to fix. It isn’t fodder for resolutions or self-help, like my lackluster morning routine. The darkness is both already conquered (2Timothy 1:10), and constantly being conquered by our light-bearing Savior (1John 2:8). Our battle is ultimately a matter of faith in Jesus, the conquering one. And so John reminds the Church of what they already know of their salvation.\n\nTo the “little children” of the faith, he reminds them: “Your sins have been forgiven” and “you have come to know the Father” (1John 2:12,14). Their salvation is secure, their reconciliation to the Father is complete (v.5). \n\nTo the “fathers,” the elders in the faith, he says (twice): “You have come to know the one who is from the beginning” (vv.13,14). God is the same God they’ve known, and known to be faithful, from the first day they believed.\n\nTo the “young men,” or those growing in the faith, he assures: “You are strong, God’s word remains in you, and you have conquered the evil one” (v.14). This is not “you can be” or “maybe one day you will be.” This is “you have” and “you are.”\n\nNotice a pattern here?\n\nThis battle is not a matter of mustering. This is a matter of trusting. The true light does not need me to flip the switch. He is already shining. My part is to stay close to Him, to walk with Him, to heed John’s warning not to sin or flirt with the darkness—not for lack of grace but out of a longing for the light of Christ to shine through (1John 2:1). With Christ in us, we are already equipped to battle the darkness. He has given us His strength and His armor (Ephesians 6:10–11). He has even conquered the foe. The darkness is not going down without a fight (1Peter 5:8), but the battle has already been won.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nOver coffee and croissants overseas, I listened to my new European friends talk about the United States. Together, we laughed over the stereotypes of Americans, but quietly, my little heart protested. After all, the people I love most and hold dearest are among those Americans. I’m one of those Americans. The thread that tied me to my family and friends at home is strong, and despite our national foibles, the States are my home.\n\nWhen I read this passage in 1 John, I immediately shrink back and mildly peep: But I love this world! It’s where all my favorites live! I’m crazy for the mess of small-town fall festivals, the sight of new dresses from fancy stores, and the secret glee that comes from winning at a game of cards. I love the world, and I miss going out and connecting with other people in it. What could John possibly mean when he says, “Do not love the world or the things in the world”? (1John 2:15). \n\nThe world, intrinsically speaking, is made to be good. God Himself declared it “very good indeed” (Genesis 1:31). So John isn’t questioning the beauty of a sunset, but rather the things of this world that pull our affections away from God. “For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride in one’s possessions—is not from the Father, but is from the world” (1John 2:16). Those three categories belong to the world, according to the inclinations of our hearts.\n\nThe lust of the flesh: Do we indulge our bodies with food, drink, touch, and comfort? Are we seeking luxury over knowing Christ?\n\nThe lust of the eyes: Do our minds crave worldly extravagance and grandeur? Do our ears strain for applause and accolades?\n\nThe pride in one’s possessions: Do our eyes rove for treasure, possessions, and delights? Do we covet the trinkets of the world?\n\nMy answer to all these questions is, “Yes, a thousand times, Yes!” Gimme those tacos, massage my feet, get me a robot butler, and bring down the house with your applause. We’re all enticed by the comforts of this world. But John is teaching us that all these delights belong to the world, and the world is passing away (v.17). We shouldn’t tie ourselves to a ship that’s sinking.\n\nInstead, we should tie ourselves to our anchor, Jesus Christ, who is pulling us heavenward. We should “remain in Him,” and keep His ways (1John 2:27). We should reserve our deepest affections for God, rather than throw them away on ice cream cones and iPhones. Before social distancing, the world seemed so readily available. Easter Sunday would come, and it was easy to distract ourselves with singing over a new dress, rather than genuinely praising the risen Christ.\n\nBut the love of the Lord is infinite and lasts forever. The Spirit’s peace never fails us. And while this world and its trappings are passing away, our hope in Christ’s promises is secure. He is our rock, quieting our hearts in the midst of whatever chaos the world throws at us. He is our real treasure, and our very great reward.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nGod the Son is a concept I can wrap my brain around. His humanity makes Jesus feel approachable, relatable even. God the Spirit is a more abstract concept, but my head and heart can still connect the dots. I’ve felt the Spirit’s stirrings in my heart. I’ve seen Him bring peace and joy to His people. But God the Father? I’m afraid that’s where you lose me. Picturing Him feels like lying on my back and watching cloud pictures float across the sky. One second I can make out the edges of the image through squinted eyes; the next, it’s gone. I have a hard time grasping God the Father and an even harder time picturing God as my Father. \n\nYou don’t have to read too closely between the lines to discern that my relationship with my dad has been complicated. There’s affection there, but we’ve learned the hard way that the bumps and potholes of life can fracture our tender bond. There’s no reason to go into the specifics here because you’re likely already thinking of your own dad. Perhaps he’s been absent, apathetic, or abusive, and when you get to passages that describe God as Father, you can’t help but question His love for you. Or maybe when you count your lucky stars, your loving, attentive earthly father is among them. Even so, your earthly father is a sinner, incapable of loving you perfectly. \n\nSo when the Bible speaks of God’s love for us as a paternal love (1John 3:1), the kind between a loving father and a devoted daughter, it can be hard to see the full picture. John’s letter urges us to keep squinting, to keep trying to see God the Father. There’s a cadence, a rhythm that beats throughout the letter. John refers to God as Father over and over. That’s the downbeat: God is Father. God is Father. God is your Father. Look again and you’ll find a counter rhythm, the sweet language of childhood, gently referring to us, the readers, as little children, beloved and born of God (1John 3:2,7; 4:7). This language isn’t patronizing, but tender. The upbeat of the letter is this: You are His child. You are His child. You are His beloved child. \n\nI’m well into my adult years, but sometimes my heart still takes the posture of a little girl, doubting God’s love or wanting to hide from Him in fear. John’s words gently bid me to look up and see the love God the Father has lavished upon me. I imagine Him kneeling down, lifting my chin to say: \n\n“So now, little [child], remain in him so that when he appears [you] may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming. If you know that he is righteous, you know this as well: Everyone who does what is right has been born of him” (1John 2:28–29). \n\nHow do we know we’re His? Because of the kind of love God offers. Though we were once sinners, separated from the Father, He reaches toward us with paternal love. We have assurance of God’s love because He does not treat us like strangers. He treats us like family. And not the way you treat a distant cousin, awkwardly kept at arm’s length. No, God lavishes love upon us. He responds to us like a perfect Father should. \n\nThe wonder of this truth may still be hard to grasp, but it doesn’t change the facts. God is the Father “who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine” (Ephesians 3:20, NIV). And we are His beloved daughters.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nThe weather had just changed from Southern hot to cool in Tennessee. Ordinarily this would have filled my little country heart with the brisk optimism that comes from a change in season: the autumnal joys of dark blues skies, scarlet leaves, and bright fires. But last year, the cold weather had me thinking crazy thoughts about swimming squirrels. Just a year before, we had three squirrels go for a swim in our pool over a stretch of three days. Now fall weather unexpectedly conjures up images of bushy tails, all wet and wilted, and tiny paws carefully paddling in cold turquoise water.\n\nWe’re not sure what exactly possessed the squirrels to swim, but I think they did it for love. I hypothesize that each successive swimmer was trying to rescue its predecessor. I think it’s a love story about a family of squirrels who were willing to stand up (or, in this case, dive in) and look death in the face as a way of looking after each other: Fear not, Mother Squirrel! I’m coming in after you! I don’t know a lot about the internal motivation of the squirrel, but I know the drive to protect loved ones is strong, no matter who you are.\n\nJohn learned about love from the Master. He got to spend years watching how Jesus loved people, and here is his conclusion: “Let us not love in word or speech, but in action and in truth” (1John 3:18). The love of Jesus is love in action. And this active love was not just limited to foot washing and lake fishing. “This is how we have come to know love: He laid down His life for us. We should also lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters” (v.16).\n\nWhew.\n\nI don’t know about you, but the kind of love I’m willing to offer is this: I’ll help you move into your apartment, I’ll let you choose the restaurant, and I’ll include you, even though you’re not that funny—and that’s for my friends! But when Jesus died for us, we were still His enemies; “while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). How much more then, should we lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters? \n\nLove is hard. Real love means real sacrifice and compromise, and unpleasantness. Jesus is our example of love in action. He literally laid down His life for us. \n\nThis kind of love feels big. Most of us have experienced some great big feeling of love, so it seems like a natural step that we can grit our teeth and turn those feelings of love into huge, selfless actions of love. It’s sometimes possible for us to swing glorious acts and promises of love when we are at our very best, dressed in our finest, with our loved ones standing around sporting giant smiles. But we are also called upon to make good on those promises at three in the morning, when no one is watching and grand gestures are the last thing on our minds. No amount of effort is enough for me to love with the consistency, action, and sacrifice that I see in the life of Christ.\n\nHow can I follow Christ’s example? And how can I teach my children to love if I can’t even love them enough to make sure all six of them have clean teeth, let alone lay down my life for them day in and day out?\n\nHere’s the element that changes everything: I am God’s child; He calls us His children. This means that when we love, no matter what time of day it is, we aren’t loving out of our own strength—we love in His strength. Christ’s example isn’t just an example; His love is also what enables us to love with action, because “he remains in us” (1John 3:24).\n\nWe were certainly created for love. And in our effort to show love, we will find ourselves laying down our lives for each other in some scary places, like jumping into a cold swimming pool or giving care to someone with no hope of reward. We can’t cut it in our own strength, but Christ’s call to love in action comes with a promise that He is with us, even to the very end.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nIt happened every night, first at 1:27 a.m. and then again at 4:02 a.m.. A low warning whistle would signal its arrival, followed by a roaring screech that thundered through our sleeping city, only waking me. Its rumble traveled from a cracked window to the front door to my bedpost, then disappeared as quickly as it came. \n\nThat train on nearby tracks opened my eyes to the darkness. I’d seen the sky turn black before going to bed, of course, but I hadn’t felt it. Suddenly, I was hyper aware that at any moment, my safe foundation could be shaken and destroyed. There, in my bed with white sheets and a black headboard, I began a countdown to sunrise, staying awake to prevent the darkness from swallowing me. \n\nEach morning, I’d attribute my sleepy eyes to the train, but each night, I’d remember it was fear. \n\nI began recognizing minor details as “warning” signs—ambulance sirens, missed calls, late arrivals—and became sure something dubious was headed my way. I didn’t know what that something was, but I knew its tracks were headed in my direction. \n\nFear is ominous and undefined in both feeling and concept. There are times I know exactly what I’m afraid of, and others when I’m just plain afraid. Many nights, I’d sit up on those white bed sheets, Bible open on my lap, wrestling with anxiety. Over and over again, I ran into the same command: Do not fear. It appears generously throughout God’s Word, yet I’d never come across a concrete definition of “fear” by itself. But what reason do we have to not fear? When the walls begin to shake and the darkness closes in, how exactly do we just “not fear”? \n\nWhen the train began to rumble into town, I wasn’t sure how to put the brakes on my fear—but I knew I could turn on the lights. Reaching over to turn on the lamp on my bedside table somehow illuminated my confidence enough to step out of bed and look outside. From my window, the street lights glowed and the train’s headlights shone in the darkness. I wonder if this is why fear isn’t clearly defined in the Bible, because it cannot stand alone. To really know it, we must turn on the lights. \n\nAnd in this case, when it comes to our fears, it is by His light, by knowing Him, that we are really able to see and make sense of what’s around us (Psalm 36:9). To know Him, we must remember His love; He Himself is love (1John 4:16). And when we know His love, we know what it is not: fear. Because “there is no fear in love… perfect love drives out fear” (v.18, emphasis mine).\n\nI’ve always read that verse in the context of my loving relationships, but what if we could also believe it in the context of our worst fears? If God is love, and there is no fear in love, then there is no fear in God. And because we are from God, He leaves the lights on for us. Held to the standard of God’s perfect love, fears don’t stand a chance. Maybe trying not to fear isn’t so impossible if it sends us searching for the light (John 8:12). May we always hold up pieces of darkness to the brilliance of His love. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nRecently, I received a text message from a friend asking about the Christian life. I read the text several times over with excitement, yes, but with anxiety too. Undoubtedly, it was an answer to over a decade of prayer, a small crack for the light to shine through. But the weight of this opportunity to share my faith in Jesus was also overwhelming.\n\nI think the apostle John would understand both my passion and my pause. Every word he writes drips with longing for people to know the truth: that Jesus is the Son of God, the way to salvation. I long for my friend to know the truth too. But sharing the gospel is on a different level than convincing someone to reduce their gluten intake; it’s a matter of spiritual life and death.\n\nMany churches utilize the personal testimonies of believers as a way to help others see the hand of the One they cannot see. We encourage each other with stories of how God has worked in our lives, how He’s freed us, and how we’ve come to know He is real. \n\nI love testimonies, but sometimes I wrongly believe my own testimony needs to convince people of God rather than simply tell them about what He’s done in my life. I automatically begin thinking about what I should and shouldn’t say, strategizing in my own strength instead of relying on God’s power to help me. No wonder I feel anxious at the mere thought of sharing the gospel.\n\nJohn rightly points us beyond his own testimony and on to God’s, which is far greater (1John 5:9). You and I aren’t the only ones testifying that Jesus is King; the Creator of the universe and everything He’s created declare the truth too (Psalm 19:1). God Himself declares the truth of Christ:\n\nThrough the Spirit, the water, and the blood (1John 5:7–8).Through prophecies and power (Matthew 1:18–24).Through the baptism of Christ Jesus (Matthew 3:16–17).Through Christ’s perfect sacrificial death (Matthew 26:28).\n\n“The one who loves God must also love his brother and sister,” in both word and deed (1John 4:21). When friends and family ask us where our hope comes from, we can let go of the pressure to find the perfect words or our need to convince them of the truth of the gospel of Christ. As God’s daughters, it is not just our testimony that matters. We are also bearing witness to God’s testimony—one that never fails. “And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. The one who has the Son has life. The one who does not have the Son of God does not have life” (John 5:11–12).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nAbout ten years ago, I was struggling with gossip, a sin I couldn’t seem to kick, no matter how hard I tried. I had become convicted about it after living with a friend who didn’t gossip at all. Like, at all. She held her tongue and guarded confidences with patience and incredible grace. She was a wonderful example to me, and her integrity highlighted the cracks in my own. So, I decided to change. \n\nAt first, I simply tried to gossip less. I’d made up my mind and thought that would be enough. It wasn’t. Then, I decided to “fast” from gossip. Now, I know that’s not how fasting works; we aren’t supposed to fast from things we shouldn’t be doing in the first place. Even so, making the concerted effort really seemed to help. I limited the fast to forty days, cutting out gossip TV shows and magazines, and just trying to be more intentional. I took it one day at a time.\n\nDuring those forty days, I was able to avoid gossip. And for the first time, I felt a sense of victory over this area of my life. Unfortunately, it didn’t stick. A decade later, I still fall prey to this sin. I still spread rumors under the guise of concern, I still ask for personal details I don’t need to hear, and I freely discuss the personal lives of famous people. I don’t like that I do it, but I do it nonetheless. I’ve come to realize I’ll struggle with it the rest of my life.\n\nOngoing struggles with sin are one of the great mysteries of the Christian life. On the one hand, following Christ means we put on our identity of Christ. In Him, we are set free from our sinful nature, and it no longer exercises unbridled power over us (Ephesians 4:22–24). On the other hand, we still sin. Even when we don’t want to sin, we do (Romans 7:15–16). In Christ we are victorious over our flesh, but we still do battle against it.\n\nJohn alludes to this struggle, stating that we are victorious and should not continue to sin (1John 5:18), but he also encourages believers to pray for others while they’re in the midst of sinning. At first, it seems like John is contradicting himself. But what John is referring to is the tension between the “already, but not yet” of being a Christian. This concept means we have one foot in eternity and one foot here on earth. We already taste the victories of Christ’s resurrection, but we don’t yet possess them completely. We will continue to struggle with sin, but it will no longer define us. \n\nThis already-not-yet state of being can be frustrating, especially when you’re tired of struggling with sin. But even in that, God does not abandon us to struggle alone. We always have the help of prayer, which is why John encourages us to ask for anything “according to his will” (1John 5:14). When we ask God to deliver us from sin, He promises to hear us, and help us. He is the true God and our High Priest, and we can trust Him with our weaknesses (1John 5:20; Hebrews 4:15).\n\nThe struggle with our flesh is real, but take heart: God isn’t finished with us yet. We are already “in the true one—that is, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life” (1John 5:20). He is the only way to eternal life, and we are only just beginning to taste the fullness that awaits (Philippians 3:20).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Walking in Love",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Lore Ferguson Wilbert\n\nThere is a foot of height between us, but I have learned to keep up, quicken my step, and match my stride to my husband’s. He ran Division 1 Track and Field for his university and, to this day, he can run a mile while I’m still changing into my sneakers. \n\nBut when we walk, we walk at a matched pace: he’s a little slower than normal and I’m a little faster. When he asks me to go for a walk, he does it because he loves me and he loves spending time with me. Walking at different paces—though more comfortable for each of us—would not be the loving thing to do.\n\nI think of this today while reading the second letter of John. He speaks of walking in love (2 John 6) and then goes on to warn of those who walk ahead on their own, rather than abide in Christ’s teaching (v.9). I can think of times when I’ve lagged behind or gotten ahead and someone else has paid the price for it. I tend to assume other people view the gospel through the same lens I do, and then I forget to communicate both love and truth to someone whose path has strayed (Ephesians 4:15).\n\nThere have been times when I have not abided in Christ’s teachings because, deep down, I think I can somehow say it better or faster or smarter. Or I have lagged behind, not kept up with the deep and fervent truth of the gospel, and become lazy in my sin and relationships with others.\n\nThe flurry of day-to-day life here on earth can cause us to forget what’s real, true, and eternal. We forget and we wander off, distracted. No wonder the writer of Hebrews said, “Let us lay aside every hindrance and the sin that so easily ensnares us. Let us run with endurance the race that lies before us, keeping our eyes on Jesus, the source and perfecter of our faith” (Hebrews 12:1–2). There is much to be said for the hard work of running the race toward Jesus, but here in his letter, John tells us to simply walk—to walk in love. \n\nFor me, it’s always easier to run ahead or lag behind, to grow distracted by what’s around me or impatient for what’s ahead of me. But John says, Beloved, walk. Match your pace to the One who loved you first and walk, one step in front of another, faithful in practice—not for a particular result, but simply to walk with your Father and enjoy His presence. This reminds me of Enoch, whose whole existence could be wrapped up with this line: he “walked faithfully with God; then he was no more because God took him away” (Genesis 5:24, NIV). \n\nTo walk in love is to match my stride to the love of God, the King of the universe, who put on flesh and became fully human to show us how to live (John 1:14; 1John 4:2). He slowed His pace to meet ours, to teach us how to run the race. In the end and by His grace, may our own lives echo these words: “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith” (2Timothy 4:7).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Imitating What Is Good",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\n“I’m being bullied.”\n\nI’m ashamed to say I didn’t believe her at first. I know a good mother ought to give her daughter the benefit of the doubt when it comes to her word against the world’s, but my instinct was to push back anyway.\n\n“Are you sure? What did he say exactly? What did he do exactly?” \n\nI peppered her with questions as we drove down our favorite winding road, our minivan pointed toward home. She held her ground, insisting a kid in her grade was mistreating her, via verbal insults and the occasional kick or shove when walking past. A few days and a few more reports later, my posture toward the tale quickly changed. I went from skeptical (“Oh, I’m sure he didn’t mean it”) to certain (“Tell me his name again, Imma call his mama”) REAL FAST. Someone was pushing my dear child around, and that was not okay.\n\nFortunately, my daughter, though thirty years my junior, handled the situation with more grace than I would have. She even informed me today that she and her nemesis are now becoming friends. Kids are awesome that way.\n\nIn his last letter to the church, this one addressed specifically to his friend Gaius, John gives one final contrast to highlight the truth of the gospel. He juxtaposes Gaius’s faithfulness to the gospel to a man named Diotrephes’s rejection of it.\n\nOh, Diotrephes was “in” the church. In fact, he fancied himself to be quite a powerful figure in the church—so powerful, he took it upon himself to decide who was in and who was out. Forget that whole “for God so loved the world” thing—Diotrephes had a better idea. He would welcome who he wanted to welcome, and he would push out who he wanted to push out (3John 10).\n\nBullies like Diotrephes often seem to get their way. They kick and shove and call names until their victims slink away, feeling defeated. Unfortunately for them, the gospel of Jesus Christ is not a power play. The biggest and baddest have no advantage here. The gospel calls us to surrender, to decrease so that Christ might increase (John 3:30).\n\nThe message of Christ does not need us to lord our power or position over others to intimidate them into belief. No, the gospel calls us to love and to service (Matthew 20:26). It invites us to stay the course, to walk in the light, one foot in front of the other (3John 4). Jesus is not a taskmaster who demands a ransom in exchange for our freedom. He Himself became our ransom; He is our freedom (Matthew 20:28).\n\nI haven’t kicked anyone out of church lately (or ever), but I’ve played the part of Diotrephes in my own life. I’ve tried to twist the gospel into something that works for me, replacing biblical teachings that don’t fit my preferences with ones that do. But the gospel will not be rewritten. It is Truth, with a capital-T, immutable in its truthfulness and irreversible in its effect on those who believe it.\n\nAs we come to the end of John’s letters today, take to heart his encouragement and his earnest plea: “Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good” (3John 11). Walk in Truth. Walk in light, imitating what is good as displayed by our Savior, Jesus Christ. Don’t mind the bullies. Whether they come dressed as self-appointed gatekeepers or as lies from inside your own head, they do not speak for God.\n\nKeep going. Keep close to Jesus. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Amanda Bible Williams\n\n“Am I the only one in this house who knows how to load the dishwasher?!” I bark my question loudly to everyone within earshot and no one in particular. Instead of listening for an answer, I groan and scrub another bowl with cereal flakes glued to the inside. I’m annoyed, and I need them to know it. But underneath my irritated sighs, there is another feeling—a fleeting but familiar twinge of disappointment in my heart’s bent toward temporary things.\n\nThis was the scene at my home last night. And banal as it is, it’s the one that comes to mind when I think of the word that echoes throughout the book of Ecclesiastes: futility. Looking for lasting meaning apart from God is futile—as futile as trying to keep the kitchen sink empty in a house filled with snack-obsessed kids and coffee-dependent adults. “‘Absolute futility,’ says the Teacher. ‘Absolute futility. Everything is futile’” (Ecclesiastes 1:2).\n\nIt feels silly to compare King Solmon’s words to my kitchen drama, and even to admit the drama to begin with. I’m a grown woman, for crying out loud! Do I really expect an empty sink to fill me up? The honest answer is, yes, I sometimes do. In the same way that I tie some bit of my self-worth to the cleanliness of my countertop, I try to craft meaning in a thousand other things: the work I do, the clothes I wear, the photos I take and captions I create, the behavior of my children, the affection of my husband, the size of my bank account and my waistline. It’s exhausting, really. Solomon knew it too: “All things are wearisome, more than anyone can say” (v.8).\n\nEcclesiastes is the wise king’s record of his own search for meaning in life “under the sun” (v.3)—that is, life here on earth. In it, Solomon found what we, too, find if we tug on our meaning threads hard enough: every earthly thing unravels. Nothing lasts. No man-crafted meaning can fill the human heart in a full and lasting way.\n\nAs hopeless as it sounds, this is good news because it points us to the only source of true meaning and fulfillment: Jesus Christ. In the kingdom of God, life’s meaning is not determined by a mortal king’s earthly research, but by the Eternal King’s perfect goodness, justice, and love. The world we see with our eyes is temporary and fraught with futility, but our life in Christ is everlasting and marked by mercy.\n\nEcclesiastes isn’t a light read, but it’s a worthwhile one. Like every other book of the Bible, it is the true and inspired Word of God, given to us that we might know and walk with Him. So, settle in and get out your spiritual bifocals, friends. Ask the Holy Spirit to guide you as you learn to view life through a kingdom lens. As we read, may we learn to find our heart’s home in Christ alone.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen L. Taylor\n\nI’ve always loved school. I was never the kid who held up the thermometer to a lamp so I could stay home, and the only time I ever cried about having to go to school was when it was the last day before summer. Even in high school, when getting up at 6:30 in the morning seemed like the worst thing in the world, I was still so happy to be at school once I got there (as long as I got there with some coffee).\n\nBecause of my love for school, my family and I have often joked that being a life-long student would be my dream job. And it’s true, really, most of my current career aspirations involve school, school, and then more school. It’s even better that my subject of choice is theology; I get to learn about God every day.\n\nWhen I was in divinity school, I had a bit of a crisis of faith. I found myself asking, “What is the point of paying all this money to learn about a God who is so beyond our comprehension that we could never learn all there is to know?” The learning began to feel ominous, daunting, and scary, rather than invigorating and inviting.\n\nThe author of Ecclesiastes is asking a similar question in today’s reading. Many scholars believe that King Solomon wrote the book of Ecclesiastes, and he is known as one of the wisest men in the Bible. He has spent all of this time learning and seeking out wisdom, but for what? He writes, “I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and folly; I learned that this too is a pursuit of the wind” (Ecclesiastes 1:17). He has come to the realization that not even the greatest knowledge will satisfy his deepest desire. Nothing compares to a relationship with God.\n\nI found this out the hard way in grad school. One of the hardest things for me was that I couldn’t seem to find colleagues who talked about God like God is real. For so many, God is something to be studied, rather than someone to know. In my life as a writer and editor now, I make every effort to both study and know God, because there is always more to learn, but He already knows it all.\n\nThere is a vast difference in knowledge about God and knowledge of God. Even though I love learning more than any other earthly thing, knowledge about God can never compare to the contentment of knowing of God—having a personal relationship with the Creator of knowledge Himself.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen L. Taylor\n\nI turned sixteen the summer before my junior year of high school. Along with the new excitement of being able to drive came the responsibility of having my first “real” job. I worked as a cashier at a neighborhood pharmacy and gift shop in a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, taking phone calls for prescription refills and stocking the shelves with face lotion and hand soap. But the best part of this summer job was something we lovingly referred to as “Christmas in July”—receiving all of the seasonal products for Christmas at the pharmacy, pricing them accordingly, and keeping track of inventory until they put out the Christmas items in late fall.\n\nI was constantly confused by the juxtaposition of the stifling Alabama summer heat with the Santa Claus figurines and snowflake ornaments. Even so, I loved that job. The fragile ornaments and figurines needed special care while unpacking, and even though it meant I left covered in glitter every day, I paid special attention to them, lifting them gingerly out of their boxes and placing them on the storage shelves where they would sit until they made their debut in the pharmacy. It might not have been the most important job, but I found purpose in it.\n\nKing Solomon had one of the most important jobs in the Old Testament. God called him to build the temple where God’s presence would dwell among the Israelites (1Chronicles 22:6–10). This was an incredible honor, one that God didn’t even entrust to King David, who was considered a “man after [God’s] own heart” (1Samuel 13:14).\n\nDespite all this, Ecclesiastes 2 tells us that King Solomon struggled with the purpose of work. He writes, “I hated all my work that I labored at under the sun because I must leave it to the one who comes after me. And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will take over all my work that I labored at skillfully under the sun. This too is futile” (Ecclesiastes 2:18–19). To the author of Ecclesiastes, leaving his work behind after death made it meaningless, a pursuit of the wind. But he goes on to explain that while he felt as though his work was meaningless, there is “nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work” (v.24).\n\nIn Genesis 1, after the creation of humankind, God instructed Adam and Eve to work, telling them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and every creature that crawls on the earth” (Genesis 1:28). God’s design for humanity always included work—it preceded the fall! Our work is not meaningless; we are called to it. And when we do our work for the glory of the one who worked first to create us, it has eternal meaning and significance.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nThere’s a word in the German language, sehnsucht, that C.S. Lewis popularized in his book Surprised by Joy. Sehnsucht refers to the yearning and longing our human hearts feel for more, for an unnamed place or the fulfillment of desires that cannot be quenched in this world alone. This Romantic concept was key to Lewis’s eventual belief in Christianity. He often encountered everyday things that evoked this pang of longing, like the smell of a bonfire or the sound of ocean waves, and filled him with an insatiable desire for more that he couldn’t quite explain. It was really the truth behind Ecclesiastes 3:11 that seized him: God has put eternity in our hearts.\n\nThink about that for a moment. Even taking into account what we do know, eternity is a bit of a mystery, isn’t it? From the Old Testament to Revelation, Scripture gives us clues, like tracks in the woods, but not enough to form a complete understanding.\n\nIn Scripture, the word eternity refers to the mind-bending truth that God has no beginning and no end, but it can also be used as shorthand for our future life with God—in heaven or in the coming kingdom. We will have the life of God, eternal by its very nature.\n\nBut in the same breath, the author also says that “no one can discover the work God has done from beginning to end” (v.11). This statement has always been a little confusing for me. If God put eternity in our hearts, why does He place limitations on our discovery? I want my longing to generate endless insight about what God is up to. Instead, I’m told “no one can discover” what God has done, at least not the full scope of it. There is knowledge He has reserved for His own purposes, which “no eye has seen” and “no human heart has conceived” (1Corinthians 2:9). And so our response to Him must be one of faith.\n\nAlthough there isn’t anything particularly special about bonfire smoke or sea salt, there are things in this life that catch our attention and draw us toward heaven. For you, it may be the feel of your baby’s hair. For another, maybe the taste of raspberry jam. Whatever it is, Scripture tells us that God has built eternity into the fabric of our hearts and that all creation declares His glory.\n\nBut it is still a mystery. God gives us some knowledge, but not enough to discover His full and perfect plan. So, as Christians, we acknowledge that, even if we don’t fully understand what eternity will be like or how time works in the kingdom of God, by faith we believe that God places this longing in us so that we seek and find Him. We pay attention to this “inner knowing” and choose to trust what God has revealed. What we see is not all there is. One day, the veil will be pulled back. Eternity is coming.\n\nUntil then, we have crackling bonfires and ocean waves to remind us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessica Lamb\n\nI was recently given a robot vacuum. I’ve wanted one for several years, and the first night we turned it on, my husband and I watched it whir around our living room in awe. Then it stopped abruptly, full of dust, dirt, and who knows what else. We emptied it and ran it again. Then again. We ran it twelve times before it finally seemed satiated. But then when we ran it the next night, it had to be emptied multiple times yet again.\n\nI initially felt defeated. Foolishly, I’d imagined that this gift would mean the permanent end of my dirty floors, instead of understanding it to be a helpful tool in the inevitable. My life is one of perpetually dirty floors, of glitter shed from preschool art projects and baby food flung surprisingly far from the dining room table. There will always be dust for the Roomba at the end of each day. While I can’t stop cleaning, I’m happier when I focus my energy on the joys of the mess-makers instead of pretending like their mess can be fully avoided.\n\nAt first glance, the hopelessness of today’s passage seems almost aggressive. Like Adam after the fall (Genesis 3), we read that “all are going to the same place” (meaning we will all die), but then the author of Ecclesiastes seemingly pivots and tells us to “enjoy [our] activities’ (Ecclesiastes 3:20–22).\n\nHe tells us to enjoy this life because we know death is a part of our post-fall reality, not just in spite of it. We can’t outrun death any easier than I can outsweep dirt in my home. But if we remember to number our days, we gain wisdom (Psalm 90:12). Against the backdrop of eternity, of knowing that our time here is limited, we can rightly hold all the good and bad of this life in proper perspective.\n\nWe can enjoy the blessings in our lives without expecting them to fill us in a way they were never meant to. We can grieve, mourn, and endure pain, because we know those, too, have an expiration date. We can learn to invest our hopes in and entrust our sorrows to an eternal God who satisfies eternally.\n\nAnd on this side of the cross, we know God does not leave us in dust. Death is not our permanent end. As believers, we will also bear the image of Jesus, the man of heaven (1Corinthians 15:49), whose defeat over the grave is the first taste of a future harvest when all believers will be resurrected (v.20). We know that after death we will find ourselves in the presence of the Lord, where there is abundant joy (2Corinthians 5:8) and resurrection victory over death (1Corinthians 15:57). The gospel transforms the meaning of life, and it transforms the meaning of death.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen L. Taylor\n\nIn January of my sophomore year of college, I laced up my hiking boots and packed a backpack (and two huge suitcases) and set off for a semester abroad in Santiago, Chile. My then-boyfriend, whom I had begun dating just a mere three months prior to leaving, wrote me a letter to read while I was gone. There is one passage from the letter that I still think of occasionally. In it was Ecclesiastes 4:12: “A cord of three strands is not easily broken,” and below it, the words “and what a strong cord we will have: you, me, and the Lord of all creation.” And although that relationship didn’t survive the strain of a semester away from each other (long distance is hard when you’re nineteen!), I’ve applied that sentiment to many of my relationships over the years: friendships, romantic relationships, and familial relationships alike.\n\nWhen I was young, I didn’t know how to braid my hair. I would end up just separating my hair into two sections and twisting them around each other, until one year at church camp when a friend taught me how to correctly braid my hair. The secret? Separating it into three sections, like the author of Ecclesiastes says in chapter 4, the cord of three strands is not easily broken. I’ve found this to be true over and over again throughout my life. My relationships with other people are so much stronger when the relationship is built on a mutual desire to serve and love God first, then each other.\n\nSurrounding yourself with people who love the Lord is so important, especially during formational seasons of life. Lack of community makes it increasingly hard to find purpose. I have found that a life in pursuit of God is so much more meaningful when it is done in community. When surrounded by other believers, seasons of fruitfulness become even more sweet, and seasons of doubt are met with comfort and understanding. The cord of three strands provides a safe place to learn, to question, and to grow. It is important that we not only seek out this kind of community for ourselves, but commit to being this kind of community for those around us. The kingdom of God is a place where all who believe are welcome. May we seek to live this out in our own lives each and every day.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nWhat does your prayer life look like in this season of life? How, specifically, do you pray each day?\n\nAs a mom with small kids and a church to help lead, I will confess that my prayer life is often rushed. I pray throughout the day, squeezing it in when I can. I pray when I wake up, I pray when I am driving, I pray at meals, I pray when someone comes to mind, and I pray as I fall asleep. Because of this rhythm, my prayer life is often hurried. And when I do pray, I am doing the majority of the talking.\n\nThis is how many of us pray, especially in hectic seasons of life. God functions as a touchstone throughout our schedule, and there is some good in this practice. It reminds us of the ever-present help we have in Him. However, I have recently become convicted that this practice lacks something important: listening.\n\nI recently heard a podcast describe the strange training regimen of NASA astronauts preparing for space. Because outer space is absolutely silent to a degree that we never experience on earth, astronauts must learn to adjust to it. They do this by spending time in a noiseless chamber where the silence is profound. In fact, the absence of noise is so absolute that you can hear the sound of your own body and its most basic, typically imperceivable, inner workings: the sound of your own breathing, or your heart beating and pumping blood to the rest of your body, the sound of skin sliding over sinew, of bones rubbing against one another—which is about when astronauts start hearing things that aren’t actually there.\n\nThis description is almost unsettling to read, but it helps us to grasp the loud volume of our everyday lives. We live in a world where silence, true silence, is difficult to come by. But as these astronauts have discovered, it is only through silence that we can hear things we’ve never heard before.\n\nFor many of us, silence is the missing ingredient from our prayer lives. We are unable to hear from God because we haven’t created the environment for it. This is what the author of Ecclesiastes is saying: He counsels, “Do not be hasty to speak, and do not be impulsive to make a speech before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few” (Ecclesiastes 5:2). This is an invitation to turn our prayer life on its head by listening more to what God has to say, rather than solely bringing petitions and requests before Him.\n\nThis can be a challenge, but it is also a word of grace and good news to any of us who do not know what to pray, or those of us who feel pressure to pray in a certain manner. Instead, it reminds us that prayer is not simply about us speaking to God, but God speaking to us. If we will only make the space to listen.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Tragedy of Wealth",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Sharon Hodde Miller\n\nSeveral months ago, our oldest son earned a toy by accomplishing a series of educational milestones. He had worked hard, and we were eager to celebrate him, so we drove to the store and purchased a LEGO set as his reward. All seemed well until we were pulling out of the parking lot and I heard his little voice from the back seat: “I wish this part of the set was different.” Not five minutes after we had purchased the toy, he was already disappointed.\n\nI have watched my son experience the same disappointment again and again. The trinket he bought with his own money. The dessert he picked out. The Nerf gun he begged us to give him for Christmas. As soon as he gained possession of each promising new prize, his satisfaction evaporated into thin air.\n\nMy son and I have this conversation often. He complains when his latest present is disappointing. I explain that he cannot derive the fullness of his joy from material things. Around and around we go. It’s a struggle my son will experience for the rest of his life, and I know this because it’s a struggle I’ve had for all of mine.\n\nOn some level, we all know that money and possessions cannot satisfy us. And yet, if we are being honest, most of us seek after them anyway. Perhaps not as cravenly as the “wolves on Wall Street,” but who among us is not enticed, and then duped, by the promise and the security of having more?\n\nIn Ecclesiastes 5 and 6, the author explains the vanity of this search. He does so by describing multiple scenarios in which the accumulation of wealth amounts to nothing. One man spends his whole life growing his wealth, but is never fully satisfied by it (Ecclesiastes 5:10). Another accumulates wealth but then loses it all in a bad venture (v.13–14). Still another earns riches and honor, which are then taken by another (Ecclesiastes 6:1–2). Over and over he depicts the precarious fragility of money, and the spiritual futility of striving after it.\n\nIn these chapters the author is harsh, because he wants to communicate a counter-intuitive idea. Counter to our logic, the accumulation of wealth is not the answer to our problems. Instead, it has all the dependability of a house of cards. Wealth and possession look sturdy to the eye, but they snap like a toothpick under the weight of our souls. That is why so many wealthy people still feel insecure—because they are. Because wealth and material things are inherently fragile and empty, no matter how much we have.\n\nWhen “all of your labor is for your own stomach,” the truth is you “will never be satisfied” (Ecclesiastes 6:7). It’s a lesson that many of us will choose to learn the hard way, or never learn at all, but we cannot escape its reality: no matter how much we earn or gain or accomplish, the pursuit of wealth is like standing atop a house of cards, when we were created for the Rock of Ages.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen L. Taylor\n\nI was living in Santiago with two of my closest friends for a semester abroad when I earned my college nickname: Kellen. It was one of those dear friends who coined the term, after witnessing me declare that getting ice cubes out of the ice tray was “literally the hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life.” She softly sighed and said, “Ah, Kellen.” And thus my new name was born, and it’s stuck, apparently, given that some of my friends still call me some form of Kellen, Kel, or Kellie more than five years later.\n\nWhen we returned to school in the states, others asked what had inspired my new nickname. My friend explained that it happened because, as usual, I was living a life of emotional extremes. My friends have always described me this way, that I’m either having the best day of my life or the worst—there’s not really much room for anything in between.\n\nLiving a life of extremes is exactly what the author of Ecclesiastes is cautioning against in today’s reading. Although one of the major themes throughout the book of Ecclesiastes is the pursuit of wisdom, and King Solomon (to whom many scholars attribute Ecclesiastes) asked God specifically for wisdom (1Kings 3:9–12), he still cautions the reader to not be excessive in their pursuit of it.\n\nHave you ever heard the phrase “too much of a good thing”? I’ve often heard it used in reference to a delicious meal or dessert, when the decadence of the meal has caused a person to feel stuffed to the point of being uncomfortable. This is what the author of Ecclesiastes seems to be saying in this passage; there can be too much of a good thing. One’s pursuit of righteousness and wisdom can get to the point where it is excessive and no longer helpful, in the same way that a pursuit of foolishness can also be excessive. Instead, we are instructed to not be excessively righteous or overly wise (Ecclesiastes 7:16).\n\nThe key here seems to be the need for balance. Like we read in Ecclesiastes 1, when it comes to the pursuit of knowledge, we must be content with not knowing everything. There will always be more to learn, more to discover, and more ways to be wise. Our contentment can be found not in the extremes of pursuing all knowledge or in casting all wisdom aside for foolishness, but in fearing God while we are on earth, knowing that a greater glory awaits us.\n\n",

I recognized his momma, knew what sports he played and what kind of music he listened to, but as I glance back in life’s rearview mirror it’s clear to me: I didn’t know a thing.\n\nIt’s taken twenty years of marriage to discover all I didn’t know; things like how he likes his eggs cooked, how his lips turn when he’s sad, and what keeps him awake with worry in the wee hours of the morning. Time and commitment have pressed our knowing past the surface, down into the deepest crevices of our hearts.\n\nSolomon’s quest for knowledge about God was unmatched. With his jaw set and fists clenched, it seems he resolved to be wise. He stacked one fact about God on top of the next, yet a heart of wisdom seemed just out of reach (Ecclesiastes 7:27–28).\n\nIn the end, Solomon’s quest to know about God ended in cynicism (v.29) and sin (1 Kings 11:4). In contrast, history remembers Solomon’s father King David as a man after God’s own heart (1 Samuel 13:14; Acts 13:22). While Solomon sought to understand the ways of God, David sought to know the heart of God. The difference in their lives couldn’t have been more stark.\n\nSolomon considered knowing God and bemoaned, “What exists is beyond reach and very deep. Who can discover it?” (Ecclesiastes 7:24). His father, however, marveled, “LORD, you have searched me and known me… Your works are wondrous, I know this very well ” (Psalm 139:1,14). Solomon’s wisdom, it seems, stayed on the surface, while David’s was pressed down into the deepest crevices of his heart.\n\nFor all the hours he spent searching and all the ink he spilled teaching, Solomon isn’t the poster child for wisdom. Not really. Instead, he shows us clearly that there’s a difference between knowing about God and actually experiencing Him in relationship, for Solomon’s head knowledge didn’t lead to lasting heart transformation.\n\nHow do we avoid Solomon’s mistake, accumulating facts about God like dusty books unread on the shelf? How can we guard against studying wisdom while acting like a fool? We remember this: Wisdom isn’t an item to collect but a Person to be cherished.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nOne summer, three friends and I strapped on our backpacks to hike the irrigation trail up the side of a canyon wall. This one canyon is a popular hiking spot because of its proximity to the Foresthill Bridge, the fourth highest bridge in the United States.\n\nHalfway up the mountain, nausea hit. Due to the intermingling of 90-degree heat and a limited water supply, I felt instant regret over suggesting this vertical trail that wasn’t even meant for hiking. (It’s an irrigation trail, after all.) Wisdom sure wasn’t the one leading the charge in this decision; it was my own ego and the myth of invincibility. After we almost passed out from dehydration, two of my friends had to shoulder my body weight and help carry me the rest of the way.\n\nScripture says that “a person’s wisdom brightens his face” (Ecclesiastes 8:1). At the time when Ecclesiastes was written, wisdom was attributed as coming from a divine source. A bright face was considered physical evidence of wisdom in the wise person’s life, just as Moses’s face shone with radiance after spending time with the Lord (Exodus 34:34–35).\n\nOur faces today may not emit a visible shining substance when we make good decisions or spend quality time with the Lord. But wisdom lingers with us the way campfire smoke stays on your clothes after hours roasting the perfect marshmallows. It favorably directs our steps and will be evident in our lives when we exercise it. Since our thoughts and actions affect those we are in community with, when we use wisdom in decision-making, we can also bring life to our collective environments. In doing so, perhaps our sphere of the world can better operate by kingdom values, such as justice, mercy, and love.\n\nProverbs offers the encouragement that “remembrance of the righteous is a blessing” (Proverbs 10:7). Those who live from a place of wisdom—whose faces are “brightened” by the Spirit of the Living God—are a blessing. It’s not that the wise avoid folly altogether. They just learn from their mistakes. As Jesus-followers, if our aim is to pursue abundant life, our lives will be marked by years that smell like wisdom.\n\nIn the end, climbing a mountain on a 90-degree day probably wasn’t wise. While our faces may have glistened, it wasn’t from nearing the Mount of Transfiguration, but from perspiring pearls of sweat that mocked our foolish decision. You’d better believe we learned from that mistake and will only plan future hikes up paths that are intended for human recreation.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Enjoy Life Despite Death",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Guest Writer\n\nA day will come for all of us when we are separated from the ones we love most. This is heartbreaking. It was never meant to be this way. Death was not a part of the design specs of the garden of Eden, and this is why death affects us so deeply; our minds and hearts were not engineered to handle the effects of death. But God has wisdom for us, and through Solomon, has given counsel for navigating “the vapor” that is life under the sun (Ecclesiastes 1:2–4).\n\nKing Solomon tells us to enjoy life while we’re living it. Plain, simple, to the point. We are to look at what God has given us—the blessings we acknowledge and everything we take for granted—and maximize our joy in those gifts from Him. We are to leverage them to care for His Church, and in the process, He makes us more aware of what we’ve been given: “The righteous, the wise, and their works are in God’s hands” (Ecclesiastes 9:1). Solomon tells us to savor our meals, to tell stories and clank our glasses with friends, looking into the eyes of our fellow image-bearers. Why? Because it won’t always be like this. These moments are fleeting, so grab them now.\n\nWisdom in this life involves more than just fighting sin; wisdom also means fully living the life God has given us. Because of Jesus’s death and rising, we realize it’s not unspiritual to enjoy life—it’s actually biblical—for the glory of God and for our good. Jesus defeating death shows us that God doesn’t ignore the beauties of physical human life; He redeems them. Therefore, we ought to enjoy them and give thanks for them in the moment, which is an act of those who are fully alive, “for the living know that they will die” (Ecclesiastes 9:5).\n\nThis does not mean that we can shirk our responsibilities in pursuit of our own personal pleasure and comfort—that’s worldliness. Disciples of Christ discover joy in the ordinariness of life. Today, resolve to be present and relish in what you have been given from God, enjoying and acknowledging “every good and perfect gift” from “the Father of lights, who does not change like shifting shadows,” despite our circumstances (James 1:17).\n\nWhatever you do in this life, do it all the way. Whatever it is that you’ve been called to do for work, family, church—do it with all your strength (Ecclesiastes 9:10). Life’s too fleeting for half-measures and good intentions. Both are ultimately empty acts, and Jesus came so that each of us “may have life and have it in abundance” (John 10:10). Love and live fully, laugh until you cry, embrace those around you. Enjoy life today, remembering that it is a vapor, but that in our God’s presence are abundant joys and eternal pleasures (Psalm 16:11).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\n“What should you do when you’re in a hole, son?”\n\nThis is the question I often ask when one of my four boys responds to correction by arguing or deflecting blame. They know the routine. The question interrupts their defense mechanisms. Most of the time, their little arms drop to their sides as they sigh and answer: “Stop digging.”\n\nIt’s a word picture Scripture gives us, and one I like to imagine David used as he corrected his son, Solomon. It was King David who penned, “He dug a pit and hollowed it out but fell into the hole he had made” (Psalm 7:15). Solomon repeated his father’s wisdom when he wrote, “The one who digs a pit may fall into it, and the one who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake” (Ecclesiastes 10:8). (Don’t you like how he added that last part?)\n\nI don’t know about you, but I don’t do a lot of pit digging, let alone snake-infested wall-breaking, for that matter. Without context, I might be tempted to race right past these verses thinking they don’t apply. But as we study Scripture’s Wisdom Literature, we see that neither David nor Solomon were warning against a literal pit, the kind that is dug with an actual shovel. No, this is a pit of trouble, and the shovel, in this case, is our words.\n\nIt was Solomon who reflected, “The words from the mouth of a wise person are gracious, but the lips of a fool consume him” (Ecclesiastes 10:12), and his father David who prayed, “LORD, set up a guard for my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips” (Psalm 141:3).\n\nIf you’ve ever felt buried under the weight of your foolish words, or wished there were a superglue that could seal your mouth shut, I’m sure you can relate. We all can. When our words have dug us into a pit of trouble, God’s Word and His Spirit remind us that wise words can only flow from a wise heart. When our speech reveals our folly we have a choice. Argue, deflect, defend, or stop digging and repent, asking the Lord to give us hearts more like His.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Bailey Gillespie\n\nOne day after work, I stopped by a retail store on the way home. Everyone and their mother was in line waiting for this one poor girl to ring them up at the register. I couldn’t help but notice she looked upset—haggard, irritated, all the unhappy adjectives. My first reaction was to wish she had a better spirit of customer service, but then something softened, and I was convicted to strike up a conversation once it was my turn. The short story was this: No, she wasn’t having a good day, because her best friend had just died, and she was the one who had discovered the body. To intensify her grief, she couldn’t find someone to cover her shift that coming Saturday and had to miss the funeral.\n\nAs you can imagine, few words felt appropriate in this situation. Doing nothing felt cold, but offering words of false comfort felt colder. How would Jesus respond?\n\nLong story short, the Spirit prompted me to do something tangible for this girl—not to persuade her that everything would be okay or that knowing God would suddenly lessen the pain, but because the moments when I’ve felt most loved were moments when another human being did something unexpected to show God’s kindness to me. So, I returned to the store with a chocolate cupcake and a card that said this: “I’m so sorry you lost your best friend. Nobody should ever have to go through that. God sees you and grieves with you.”\n\nThe world encourages us to spend our days like money, trading them in for pleasure and recreation. But, friends, God urges us to invest our lives in the kingdom. He promises that we will reap a harvest one day (Galatians 6:9). We can’t guarantee that one conversation or random act of kindness will be the one to change someone’s life, but we can trust that God does not waste one moment of our lives. Ecclesiastes 11:6 says it this way: “In the morning sow your seed, and at evening do not let your hand rest.”\n\nEven while operating out of a focus on life under the sun, the writer of Ecclesiastes lifts his head for a moment to comment on what life looks like in the kingdom. He acknowledges there is a God, one who has the power to make what we sow flourish, as well as bring judgment on our actions.\n\nWe never know God’s timing or how He might multiply the work of our hands. So, we sink our teeth into each day. Investing, planting, watering, we pray for the flourishing of God’s movement in the world. But even when we don’t see the fruit, God is still trustworthy with the results.\n\n“Whatever you do, do it from the heart, as something done for the Lordand not for people, knowing that you will receive the rewardof an inheritance from the Lord” (Colossians 3:23–24).\n\nInstead of spending all our days like money, let’s look for ways to invest in life. Giving someone a cupcake to remind them that their grief isn’t insignificant feels so small—almost silly. But as I watched the girl behind the register run around the counter with a big smile and arms spread open, it felt like Jesus was up to something.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBy Jessica Lamb\n\nMy second child recently turned seven months old. Though I experienced these same developmental milestones with my first, something about this second time around has left me even more in awe of how quickly babies grow and change. In his first few days, my son could only hold up his head for seconds at a time. When he came home from the hospital, he could only see about fifteen inches away, just far enough to make out my face as I held him and stared at his tiny features. He can now see me clearly from across the room and crawl toward me as fast as his not-so-tiny legs can move.\n\nI sometimes wonder if that’s one of the reasons he cries on occasion, even when every need I can think of is met. Because today, his world looks totally different than it did yesterday. The whole world is open for discovery, but that growth meant a sharp change in perspective.\n\nI imagined that sort of cry at the end of our reading today. The author of Ecclesiastes has been writing at length about life “under the sun.” A life where delight fades, strong men stoop, songs grow faint, and dust returns. A life where so much is “absolute futility.” Then, in the last few verses, there are these words:\n\nBe warned: there is no end to the making of many books, and much study wearies the body.When all has been heard, the conclusion of the matter is this:fear God and keep his commands, because this is for all humanity.For God will bring every act to judgment, including every hidden thing,whether good or evil (Ecclesiastes 12:12–14).\n\nFor almost the entirety of my professional career I have worked in publishing, and I always want to voice a hearty “Amen!” at verse 12. There is no end to the making of books, to writers and philosophers and poets and politicians and artists and parishioners trying to make sense of our place as humans in this world. But the path to seeing our days differently is made clear here, because there is more to see than we once thought. For every single one of us, the key to meaning is the same: fear God, and keep His commands.\n\nThis is for all of us, because God is for all of us. He is our Creator, whose eyes saw us while we were still being formed (Psalm 139). He is our Sustainer, who knows when a single sparrow falls, clothes the flowers of the field, and anticipates our needs and worries (Matthew 6:25–34;10:29–31; 1Peter 5:7). He is our Savior, who invites us to follow Him and be part of His kingdom work here and now. His Word equips us to see our world through His perspective, and recast all our days in light of eternity.\n\nSo remember your Creator, find your confidence in the Lord. He is the resurrection, He is the life. This is for all of us, if we’ll just take hold and believe it.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 1:1-17, 2 Samuel 7:12-16, 2 Corinthians 5:17\n\nIf you could have access to only one book for the rest of your life, which would you choose? \n\nJudging from their devoted habits and bold commentary, it seems a great many theological giants in Church history would have made Romans their go-to text for a lifetime. Early church father John Chrysostom had the book read aloud to him once a week. Poet and preacher Samuel Taylor Coleridge called it “the profoundest piece of writing in existence.” The famous sixteenth-century Bible translator William Tyndale wrote of Romans, “It is the principal and most excellent part of the New Testament… No man can read it too oft.” Martin Luther, St. Augustine, and John Wesley all came to assured faith through the impact of Romans.\n\nWhat is it about this book that has captivated the attention of believers across the ages? What makes Romans so unique? \n\nAll Scripture is God-breathed and equally valuable—God’s special revelation given to us that we might know Him. But Romans is distinct in that it provides the most comprehensive expression of the gospel found in the Bible. This book reaches back deep into the Old Testament to walk us through the origin and problem of sin, the reality of guilt, and the impossibility of saving ourselves. And it presents, systematically yet succinctly, the ultimate rescue we’re given in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn short, Romans contains the essential gospel.\n\nFrom the opening statements of his letter, Paul makes clear his purpose for writing: to present and promote the gospel of Jesus Christ. He introduces himself as Christ’s servant, “set apart for the gospel of God” (Romans 1:1). He addresses the letter to “all who are in Rome, loved by God,” expressing his commitment to telling them “the good news about [God’s] Son” (vv.7-9). And he conveys how desperately he has desired to visit the city personally: “I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome” (v.15).\n\nPaul then turns from his brief introduction to make a stunningly clear pronouncement on where he stands when it comes to the message of Christ:\n\nFor I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.\n\n– Romans 1:16\n\nPaul was confident in his calling to preach the gospel because he was certain of the saving power of his God. I am a servant of Christ… I am an apostle… I am set apart for the gospel… I am eager to preach the good news… I am not ashamed. \n\nIt is with this unshakeable confidence that Paul, the self-proclaimed “worst of sinners” (1 Timothy 1:15), wrote to the believers at Rome—to explain to Jewish and Gentile converts alike what it means to believe in and be redeemed by Jesus Christ. For this is no metaphorical salvation; it is the real-life rescue of broken and complicated people by the all-powerful hand of a merciful God.\n\nLean in close as Paul presents his longest letter in Scripture, a sermon on what it means to be a Christ follower in this life. Listen as he tells of God’s holiness, justice, and compassion. Read this book as though it is telling a single story—the story of how God rescues us through the sacrifice of Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Righteousness and Wrath of God",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 1:18-32, Proverbs 1:7, 2 Timothy 3:1-9\n\nIn all of Paul’s letters, there are few bleaker passages than the one we encounter in Romans 1:18-32. Here Paul paints a picture of total depravity, gleeful rebellion, and blind rejection of God—all of which incur the deserved wrath of God. It’s dark and it’s grim, but there is one thing you especially need to know about it:\n\nIt’s your story.\n\nIf you’re like me, that might sound strange. Like many lifelong Christians, I was raised in the church, a rule-following “good girl” who never colored outside the lines. My life looks nothing like Paul’s portrait of self-destruction. And yet, his language is intentionally vague. He never specifies who this passage is about. Scholars have speculated—perhaps it’s about Adam and Eve, or perhaps he is describing non-Christians. But most scholars, like Dr. Douglas Moo, a professor at Wheaton College, interpret his words more broadly: “[Paul] has in view human beings generally, prone to turn away from God because of the original fall into sin.” \n\nIn other words, this passage is about us. \n\nPaul speaks of the “godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth”—the people who struggle with “envy, murder, quarrels, deceit, and malice” (vv.18, 29). And those people he’s describing? Well, they’re us—all of us. Paul isn’t singling out a particular group of people; he’s diagnosing the human condition. \n\nLeft to our own devices, sin distorts our souls like water-warped wood. For every human ever born, that is our story. At least, it would have been our story had God not intervened.\n\nWhat we see in Romans 1:18-32 is a vision of our fate, had God not planned our rescue. Without God’s grace we were all “by nature deserving of wrath” (Ephesians 2:3). To understand exactly what these harsh words mean, we must be careful not to confuse God’s “wrath” with human forms of anger. Theologian John Stott describes human anger as “irrational and uncontrollable emotion, containing much vanity, animosity, malice, and the desire for revenge.” God’s wrath, on the other hand, “is absolutely free of all such poisonous ingredients.” \n\nBy comparison, God’s wrath is His “holy hostility to evil.” This hostility is not arbitrary. God does not pick rules out of a hat, and smite those who fail to conform. No, God directs His hostility squarely at the destructive effects of sin. Sin steals, kills, and destroys everything it touches, including the crown jewel of His creation: humankind. It degrades and dismantles us, and God’s response to this cosmic terrorism is total opposition. God opposes sin because He is good and righteous and just. \n\nHe also opposes it because of His love. Like a father’s white-knuckle rage at his son’s addiction, or a mother’s howling grief at her daughter’s eating disorder, God’s wrath is an expression of His love. It is hostility towards that which devours His children whole.\n\nThis side of eternity, we may never understand the mysterious balance between God’s active condemnation and the natural consequences of human sin. But together, these two elements constitute God’s righteous wrath against all human sin. That is our story—every one of us. Apart from the grace of God, we would only choose death. \n\nWhenever we read these words, we must ask the Spirit to reveal ourselves within them, because we cannot have the good news without the bad news. We cannot call it “salvation” if we are not being saved from something—namely, ourselves. Self-ruin is the only place our sin will ever take us. But, thanks to Jesus, it doesn’t have to.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 2:1-16, Deuteronomy 16:18-20, Titus 1:15\n\nHead shaking, brow furrowed, she looked perplexed. Confusion filled her dark brown eyes. “I don’t understand,” she said.\n\nI explained further. “The Chinese and Japanese character used to translate ‘sin’ is the word zui, which means ‘crime.’”\n\nShe nodded and motioned for me to continue.\n\n“I think that translation can be somewhat limiting. I imagine you haven’t really spent time in jail or committed a crime like robbing a bank. I imagine you consider yourself a pretty good person.”\n\nShe nodded again. \n\n“I used to think of myself as a pretty good person, too” I said. “But then someone asked, if a movie were made of my life, if there were certain scenes I’d want deleted. I knew exactly which scenes I didn’t want anyone to see. And these scenes were not just of the times I did things I knew I shouldn’t, but also when I didn’t do things I knew I should. Our sin problem shows itself in both ways—in the things we do and the things we don’t do. We all sin. No one lives a life free of scenes they wouldn’t want others to see.”\n\nPaul goes to great lengths in the first three chapters of Romans to help us understand the totality and consequences of our sin. He lists the manifestations of sin at the end of chapter one, then goes on to explain how his readers not only judge others, but also practice the very things for which they pass judgment. \n\nAnd it’s true: most of us consider ourselves “good” people, qualified to judge others for their many shortcomings—that is, until we place our own sin-plagued lives next to Christ’s righteousness. Jesus is the only one who lived a perfect, God-honoring, shame-free life. \n\nBoth Jews and Gentiles—and both you and I—fall short under God’s holy judgment. We are all guilty, often of the very same things for which we condemn others. But there is good news: \n\nFor God loved the world in this way. He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.\n\n– John 3:16\n\nWe are born spiritually dead, our sin separating us from a life with God. But God, in the person of Jesus Christ, has made a way for us to know Him, both in this earthly life and for all eternity (John 17:3). \n\nJust as God Himself provides the way for us to be reconciled to Him, He also does the work of revealing to us our sin—of showing us how our “goodness” falls short of His righteousness. The Holy Spirit does the convicting (John 16:8), which frees us to love and to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15).\n\nIn Romans, Paul writes systematically to knock away our sense of ever being righteous in and of ourselves. God’s invitation is not to mere ethics or manufactured goodness, but to the utter, complete transformation that takes place when we are made new in Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nMay God melt away our pride that keeps us from total dependence on Him. By His grace, may we love others, even as they fall short like we also do. And may we recognize and receive God’s kindness that leads us to repentance. Amen.\n\nVivian Mabuni is a speaker and author, and a sushi, white Christmas lights, post-its, and coffee-with-friends lover.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 2:17-29, Deuteronomy 7:25-26, Psalm 51:1-12\n\nIn one of my seminary classes, we were to read Athanasius’ On the Incarnation, as well as— according to the syllabus—the book’s preface written by C.S. Lewis. Paying close attention to the syllabus (thought not that close), I read both the preface and the introduction.\n\nA few weeks later, during his lecture, the professor pointed out that we technically didn’t have to read the book’s introduction, but he said if we’d been smart, we would have. He explained this had been his intention—even if the syllabus hadn’t spelled it out explicitly.\n\nWas he assuming we were mind readers? Not really. He just had expectations. \n\nAt some point, we all give instructions—to colleagues, to children, to friends, to husbands—that may not be perfect or exact, but we hope the recipient will pick up on our intent, on the spirit of what we’re asking them to do. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t. \n\nPaul is giving a similar instruction here to the Jewish Christians in Rome. He is echoing Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, asking Jesus’ followers to read deeper into the Law. Paul tells them it’s not about following the letter of the law. It’s about following the heart of the One who wrote it. \n\nPaul’s laundry list of law-breaking activities in verses 21-23, reads similarly to what Jesus said in Matthew 5:\n\nYou have heard that it was said to those of old, “You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.” But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment.\n\n– Matthew 5:21-22\n\nJesus preached these words to some who knew the Law backwards and forwards, but He was holding up a magnifying glass to their hearts. They weren’t out murdering people—they were law-following Jews, after all—but what was going on in their hearts? Were they angry with their brother? Jesus said then they, too, are deserving of punishment. The spirit of the Law was broken, even if the exact rule was not. \n\nPaul does the same for his readers. He questions their obedience to the Law, but then he reminds them it’s the posture of their hearts that matters most. These proud Jewish Christians came from a long heritage of trying to earn righteousness by following the Law. They too easily forgot that Jesus came to fulfill the Law for them, to make them righteous by simply believing in Him. \n\nIt’s not hard to see myself in the Jewish Christians of Rome, slipping back into trying to follow the rules rather than the One who wrote them. It’s easy to think my righteousness comes from  acting the right way, rather than from “the Way” Himself (John 14:6). But as the psalmist tells us, “would God not discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart” (Psalm 44:21).\n\nIf I’m honest, what’s going on inside my heart is usually much uglier than how I act on the outside. Thankfully, Jesus came to wash me clean from the inside out. This is the beauty of the cross and the gift of the Holy Spirit: to compel me to seek God’s heart first, and obey His law by the help of His Spirit.\n\n \n\nMelanie Rainer is the director of content for JellyTelly, where she writes and edits family spiritual formation resources.

He lived, died, and rose again for sinners. He forgives sinners. And sinners who place their faith in Him are welcomed into His family.\n\nThat’s really good news for sinners, right? And Scripture leaves no doubt. You, me, and every person on earth… we’re all sinners. That’s the bottom line Paul lays out in Romans 3:23.\n\nWe’re all broken, needy, and messed-up in a way that simply being “good” can never fix.  \n\nSince the Garden of Eden, our identity as humans has been marked by our tendency to rebel against God. That’s why we can never behave our way into a right relationship with Him. The most well-behaved, law-abiding, church-attending, choir-singing, modest-dressing, moralistic person alive, apart from Jesus Christ, is still dead in her trespasses and sins (Eph 2:1).\n\nThe heartbeat of the gospel is not, “Clean up your act, obey the rules, and God will forgive you.” That’s moralism, not Christianity. Any one of us who has ever tried to be a perfect person, even for a day, knows that approach simply doesn’t work. That false gospel stands in direct contradiction to the true one: Christ died for sinners. Because He loves us, remember?\n\nDo we encourage each other—and ourselves—to obedience? Absolutely! But let’s also remember that righteousness does not come through our obedience. Right standing with God comes only through faith in Jesus—His works and not our own. As Paul says in verse 24, “They are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”\n\nThrough Jesus, grace flows freely to sinners. Through Jesus, those guilty and condemned are declared righteous—justified by His sacrifice, by grace through faith. And through Jesus, polluted sinners exchange filthy rags for robes of righteousness.\n\n“I greatly rejoice in the Lord,\n\nI exult in my God;\n\nfor has clothed me with the garments of salvation\n\nand wrapped me in a robe of righteousness… ” (Isaiah 61:10).\n\nCarrie Gaul is a biblical correspondent for Revive Our Hearts. She and her husband Dennis have two married children and are enjoying grandchildren. Carrie has a deep love for God’s Word and a passion to see women grow in ever-increasing intimacy with Jesus through the study and application of His Word.\n\nEditor’s Note: In Romans, Paul is building a case for the good news that is ours in Christ by faith. He uses these early chapters to establish our guilt before God—which he does to establish our need for a Savior. One of the most challenging aspects of the gospel is that it is based on the death and resurrection of Christ, necessitated by our own sin. We cannot understand the depth of God’s love for us in Christ without understanding the depth of our need for that sacrifice and the sin it covers. Because of Jesus, our sin is not counted against us, so we are never just “sinners.” We are redeemed sinners. A new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). What an amazing gift it is to know that “God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).\n\nThis essay was revised on August 28, 2017. \n\n",

Give me all the before-and-after shots of your kitchen, bathroom, closet—even your hair!—magically morphed from cluttered to clean. I never, ever tire of them.\n\nReading Romans 3:21-31 reminds me of my makeover obsession. These verses are all about our “after”—who we are because of God’s grace “by the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (v.24). The power of this passage lies in its contrast to the one before it. What would an “after” photo be if we never saw the “before”?\n\nA beautiful kitchen is a beautiful kitchen. But when we see that kitchen as it once was—dated tile, linoleum floors, and missing cabinet doors—compared to its transformed state of marble countertops and hardwood floors, we appreciate its newness and beauty that much more.\n\nSo let’s back up to Romans 3:20, our “before” shot that says, “For no one will be justified in his sight by the works of the law, because the knowledge of sin comes through the law.” That’s bad news for us. It means all the good stuff we did last week, all the good deeds and hard work—it’s all meaningless in itself.\n\nBut…\n\nBut now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the Law and the Prophets. The righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.\n\n– Romans 3:21-22\n\nThis, friends, is the good news! No, we are not justified by the law, but we are justified in Christ.\n\nGod presented him as an atoning sacrifice in his blood, received through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be righteous and declare righteous the one who has faith in Jesus.\n\n– Romans 3:25-26\n\nNow, imagine knowing this good news with no understanding of the bad news that preceded it. Imagine seeing the “after” without seeing the “before.” It wouldn’t really be good news then, would it? In light of the bad news, the promise found in verses 25-26 is that much brighter, more hopeful. The contrast is everything.\n\nOur before is not a pretty picture. It is devoid of God and, therefore, full of despair. As Paul quoted the Hebrew scriptures, “all have turned away…ruin and wretchedness are in their paths” (Romans 3:12,16).\n\nBut…\n\nThis passage today is our after. The ones who have faith in Jesus are righteous. Not the ones who do the most, achieve the most, or follow the letter of the law the best. Unlike those HGTV makeovers, it’s not the amount of work we put in that brings us from before to after; it’s Christ’s work on the cross that transforms us. He, and He alone, declares us righteous before the one true God.\n\nPerhaps this is why I love seeing visual transformations so much. They help me to remember the gospel’s redemption in my own life. It’s a reminder I desperately need to hear, over and over again. It was not our blood, sweat, and tears that brought us back into relationship with God. It was His.\n\nWe are forever grateful, Jesus.\n\nAndrea Lucado is a freelance writer, Texas native, and the author of the memoir English Lessons: The Crooked Path of Growing Toward Faith.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 4:1-25, Psalm 32:1-2, Ephesians 2:4-7\n\nLet me tell you what everybody’s talking about these days: kale. I know, first telegrams were all the rage, later to be followed by fast food drive-thrus, “The Electric Slide,” and space travel. But now we’ve finally peaked with an affection for curly leaves that sprout from the ground.\n\nAt first, I really thought I was missing out. Kale seemed to be every celebrity’s best kept secret, every magazine’s healthy choice, and every grocery cart’s consistent companion. So, I tossed a bunch of kale into my produce bag and raced to the checkout line, anxious to taste this treat of the century. In the car, I tore the stem off like a cupcake wrapper, stuffing a handful of leaves into my mouth. I wanted to like it more than anything, but friends, gag reflexes don’t lie.\n\nIn contrast to the controversial kale, it would be difficult to find someone who didn’t like Abraham. His popularity was well-deserved, his reputation flawless, his character impeccable. The Jews looked up to him as a forefather paving the trail of faith, a man whose righteousness, they hoped, would inspire their own. If they were anything like me, they’d stuff themselves silly with anything that promised a chance at gaining his status.\n\nPerhaps some Jews tried to duplicate Abraham’s righteousness with their own try-hard attempts at earning favor with God. But no matter their determination, the results would remain bitter and unsavory. Exhausted, they might look to him and wonder, How does he do it?\n\nI asked the same of my friend Amanda, who eats a salad for lunch every single day and, consequently, is very well versed in the area of all-things-kale. She laughed, explaining that no one eats kale plain. Apparently (you probably already knew this), you drench it in dressing, blend it in a smoothie, or soften it with olive oil. By itself, kale isn’t the star ingredient, but when covered in other flavors, it gets all the credit for being delicious. Abraham’s secret had a similar flavor: “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness” (Romans 4:3).\n\nAt first glance, it’s easy to assume that if anyone could achieve righteousness, it would probably be a guy like Abraham. But like you and me, he had sin pumping through his veins. And so Abraham is not the achiever in this passage—God is. Abraham simply believed God and His promises.\n\nNow to the one who works, pay is not considered as a gift, but as something owed. But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who declares the ungodly to be righteous, his faith is credited for righteousness.\n\n– Romans 4:4-5\n\nHear this good news, friends. Because Christ was righteousness in our place, we, too, are drenched in His goodness, credited with His coveted status—we’re the very fragrance of Christ before our Father (2 Corinthians 2:14). May we always believe with the faith of Abraham, receiving God’s promises with open hands and thankful hearts. Amen.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 5:1-11, Galatians 4:6-7, Ephesians 2:18-22\n\nSeven years ago I found myself so emotionally, physically, and spiritually debilitated that just getting out of bed in the morning was difficult. I’d never struggled with acute depression before, but after soldiering through the deaths of several of my loved ones and a cancer scare of my own, my get-up-and-go was totally gone. All I wanted was to wave a white flag at life and crawl under the covers, venturing out just long enough to grab another pint of ice cream.\n\nIf someone had given me some perky acrostic or suggested I listen to a sermon entitled, “Ten Things Victorious Christians Do to Kick Disappointment and Despair to the Curb,” I’d have kicked them in the shins. Fortunately, Lynn, the Christian counselor I’ve gone to for years, doesn’t prescribe the dangerous meds of “minimizing grief” or “multiplying guilt.” Instead, she was silent as I sobbed, empathetic as I lamented.\n\nLynn gave me this advice: “Cling to Jesus and do the next right thing.” \n\nShe told me to stop trying to tackle the troubles of an entire day, much less a week, month, or year. I was simply to move forward one step at a time. Some days I’d wake to the alarm clock only to be hit with a shock of emotion as I remembered my circumstances. And other days, just whispering the name of our Savior gave me enough grit to pull back the covers and get out of bed.\n\nDay by day, inch by laborious inch, Jesus led me by the hand through that dark valley of life— one step at a time. \n\nI know far too many people who have lost their joy and all but lost their faith in Jesus because endurance was an overlooked muscle group in their Christian vocabulary. And so they’d stop attending Bible study, then church, fading away from their faith community in the midst of their malaise. Some have been wounded by that very same community of believers. Others have simply lost the energy and will to put on a happy face, to pretend their get-up-and-go hasn’t left them too.\n\nSurely our Creator-Redeemer weeps over the gaping holes in the fabric of His covenant family. We weren’t created to be wincing, jaded isolationists. We were created in God’s image, in the image of the triune God who exists in perfect relational harmony with Himself as Father, Son, and Spirit (Genesis 1:26). We’re hardwired for relationship, for communing with others of the faith.\n\nWhen life leaves us disappointed, disillusioned, and despairing, we need to resist the urge to withdraw from the body of Christ. Instead, we need to move toward other passionate—albeit flawed—Christ-followers to walk with us toward healing. We need to be honest with them, with God, and with ourselves about the true state of our hearts. We need them circling around us, crying out, “Abba Father!” on our behalf, reminding us of the Truth: we are no longer slaves, but daughters of the one true God (Galatians 4:6-7).\n\nTogether, we can persevere toward the living hope of the Lord Jesus Christ to whom we’ve been called. \n\nOnly God can love us unconditionally. Hoping in Him will never disappoint us the way the world does time and time again. Because “God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit” we can learn to rejoice and hope again, even in our pain (Romans 5:3,5). But it’s only in clinging to Him that we will find the strength to move forward in faith, one step at a time.\n\nLisa Harper is a master storyteller with a masters of Theological Studies from Covenant Seminary.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 5:12-21, Genesis 3:17-19, 1 Corinthians 15:21-22\n\nSometimes, the weight of living this life just gets to us. It feels sticky and scratchy, less graceful and more gritty. We wander into and out of seasons that leave us asking where God is in the middle of grief or loss or emptiness. \n\nA few weeks ago, I lost my grandfather slowly and suddenly. He was tired one day and hospitalized the next. Not three weeks later, he was gone.\n\nIn those days between admitting him to the hospital and him meeting Jesus, I couldn’t seem to rectify the fact that what was happening felt so foreign and yet so expected. Death is a terrible reality that we live with, an awful and haunting sort of event that wrecks us. But, as we learn early on, it’s inevitable: death is a part of life.\n\nOne night, as I was adjusting his oxygen mask, my fingers combed through his hair, damp with sweat because his breathing was so labored. It reminded me of my nieces waking from a nap, their fine hair damp and sticking to their foreheads. And then I thought of my grandfather as a young boy, running around, playing and sweaty. His mother must have pushed his hair off his forehead, just as I was doing now.\n\nLater, after he was gone, a friend would remark to me, “You know, we labor into this world and we really labor out of it, too.”\n\nOne evening around dusk, I pulled him up to a sitting position, and together we shuffled over to a chair by the window. I sat in front of him, asking question after question about his life. The vesper light caught his eyes as he told me about a career of flying planes all around the world for the Navy. We both knew things were drawing to a close. Still, in that moment, I sensed a very real peace. We both did. It was as if we both understood that our bodies may break down, but Christ has given us life that will carry on for the rest of eternity.\n\nPart of me couldn’t believe his earthly life was coming to an end. But another part of me knew better: this is what happens. Sometimes, we live so deeply rooted in our fallen, fragile reality that we forget there is another, better, truer one.\n\nFor if by the one man’s trespass the many died, how much more have the grace of God and the gift which comes through the grace of the one man Jesus Christ overflowed to the many.\n\n– Romans 5:15\n\nWhen I’m in the throes of hospital visits and errands and trying to make the best of every moment, I can forget the truth. Because of Jesus, life is more than survival or death. It is eternal (Romans 5:20-21).\n\nThese days since my grandfather’s death, I’ve been thinking about how, as a Christian, I live a life marked by beautiful disagreement. Even when it seems death is the only option, the life and light of Christ finds a way to break through. Even when 21 shots are fired and a flag is folded graveside, there is still hope. Even as we watched the setting sun one last time together, we saw the beauty in the darkness.\n\nEven in death, grace reigns.\n\nMelissa Zaldivar is a social in the world of academics and an academic in the world of socials.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebekah Lyons\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 6:1-14, 2 Corinthians 5:18-21, Colossians 3:1-11\n\nMy daughter was baptized a few months ago.\n\nShe decided to follow Jesus in her elementary years, and considered baptism a long while until she entered middle school. The week prior, a pastor from our church sat down in our kitchen to talk to her about the weight of this decision. She was choosing to publicly testify Christ as her Lord to anyone who asked. This was a commitment to follow and serve Jesus no matter what, even when it was difficult.\n\nThe following Sunday she wrote a letter to Jesus, just between them, and pinned it to a wooden cross at the front of our sanctuary before taking her turn in the waters. As her daddy lowered her beneath the water he offered the words, “buried with Jesus in the likeness of His death, and raised to walk in newness of life” (Romans 6:4).\n\nScripture says we joined Jesus in His death when we were baptized. Death no longer rules over Christ Jesus, nor does it rule over those who believe in Him. What’s more, when we died with Christ, we were set free from the power of sin. “For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time.” As believers in Christ Jesus, we are to “consider [ourselves] dead to sin and alive to God” (vv. 9-11).\n\nBut if we’ve truly died to sin, why do we continue to live in it? The act of sharing in Christ’s death wouldn’t be a one-time thing any more than taking communion would be a one-time thing. In fact, we’re told to examine our hearts before we take the bread and the cup (1 Corinthians 11:27). We ought to examine our hearts in everything and invite God to search our hearts too (Psalm 139:23).\n\nWhen we take a lackadaisical approach to our sin, we give it room to rule over us, to distract us. As those who have been crucified with Christ, sin is no longer our ruler. We are not under the law but under grace (Galatians 2:20; Romans 6:14).\n\nThis begs the question: What in my life needs to die each day? What has become an idol, a security, a focus, or a prop that has pushed God aside? I never seem to see sin enter my heart until I hear it roll off my tongue—a little sarcasm here, a critique there. Then envy soon follows, before resentment settles in and camps out. \n\nFor starters, my pride needs to die. It needs to die a thousand deaths. It’s the temptation of the religious leader to get puffed up by our words, thinking the message is ours. But the truth is that God has planted His Word in our hearts (Hebrews 10:16). We are simply called to speak His Word when summoned.\n\nThere’s something else that needs to die for me in this season: production. It’s time for me to get quiet after a long season of pouring out. Making room for the death of an idol opens wide the gates for a new beginning, a new imagination for what God will bring about in the days ahead. I’m walking out these days with an expectant heart, putting my ear to the ground, and listening for a fresh refrain of reverence.\n\nI wonder, is there something that needs to die for you today? When you are joined in Christ’s death through faith, you are also raised with Him in newness of life. Laying down your idols will open the floodgates for freedom to reign once more, making room for new life to spring forth again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 6:15-23, Galatians 5:13-14, 1 Peter 2:11-17\n\nWhen I was in elementary school, I decided I was going to grow an apple tree in our backyard. I didn’t tell my family about it. I wanted to do it secretly so that one day when there was a blossoming apple tree growing out of my mother’s flower bed, everyone would be amazed and I could reveal that I had grown it.\n\nI hoarded an apple seed from an apple I had eaten earlier in the day and smuggled it into the backyard when no one was looking. I dug a shallow hole in the flowerbed, placed the seed inside, and covered it with dirt. Then I hoped for the best.\n\nIn our last Romans passage we learned that Jesus’ death and resurrection does not mean life is a free-for-all, or that we can live however we like because of God’s grace. It means our motivation has changed. We don’t live under the yoke of the law any longer; we live under the covering of Christ, and that gift of grace motivates us to live by God’s Word.  \n\nIn Romans 6:15-23, Paul gives us another reason why Christians should not continue to sin simply because grace is now at play: fruit.\n\nBefore you knew Christ, Paul says, you were slaves of sin (Romans 6:17). And “…when you were slaves of sin, you were free from allegiance to righteousness. So what fruit was produced then from the things you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death. But now, since you have been liberated from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification—and the end is eternal life!” (Romans 6:22).\n\nWhen we interpret the message of grace as permission to continue sinning, we miss out on living a life that bears fruit, and instead, we live lives marked by death, for that is what sin is. This is not only harmful to our own souls; it is harmful to our witness. First Peter 2:12 says, “Conduct yourselves honorably among the Gentiles, so that when they slander you as evildoers, they will observe your good works and will glorify God on the day he visits.”\n\nOur lives do not bear fruit in order for us to look good to others. Our lives bear fruit so that others will see it and know its Source. A fruitless life does not point to our Creator. A fruit-filled one glorifies Him with each step we take (John 15:8).  \n\nYou can probably guess what happened with my apple seed in the backyard. Absolutely nothing. While I had the big idea right—apple seed leads to apple tree—I went about it all wrong. If you really want to grow an apple tree in your backyard, it’s much more complicated than burying a seed and hoping for the best. I looked it up. The real process involves things like “germinating” and “grafting” and transferring the plant from various-sized pots until it is ready for the ground. Then maybe, hopefully, your tree will grow and bear fruit.\n\nI eventually forgot all about my apple tree. Days, weeks, and months went by, and since nothing was growing, I forgot about the seed and my little secret plan. It had been a fruitless effort because I had not properly cared for its growth.\n\nOh, that my Christian life would be the opposite of that poor, non-existent apple tree, that I would live motivated by grace so that others would see a life in full bloom, and that its beauty would point them to its source.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Annie Downs\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 7:1-13, Proverbs 1:19, John 14:6-7\n\nMy buddy Andrea wrote yesterday’s post, and I loved it. But no offense to her, sometimes real, live fruit can show up without much planning. Here’s what I mean.\n\nI follow one of my favorite Instagram accounts specifically for the Insta-stories. One account I adore is of an incredibly fun mom living in Florida. Last week, she did three or four videos of the same tree: an avocado tree. Hanging from the branches were dozens of avocados.\n\n“Look at these beauties!” she yelled to the camera, “And my husband takes all the credit for this tree!”\n\nApparently, a few years before, he’d planted the pit of an avocado there in the backyard, just behind the pool, and voila! AVOCADOS! He didn’t plan it or even care for it. Just planted the pit once the original avocado was eaten and then didn’t think about it again.\n\nJust a dead pit. Buried in the ground.\n\nWhat viewers like me saw was the tree—the product, the fruit grown from the death. But the part we didn’t see were all those days in the middle. The dead days. The days where nothing grew and nothing changed on the outside, but everything was changing on the inside.\n\nI need to see the avocados. And I need to see the dead days too. Because I feel them. Don’t you? There are stories in my life that just plain feel dead. It feels like I did all the work I knew to do, and yet nothing seems to be growing or changing.\n\nBut death brings life. So it is with us because of Jesus.\n\nTherefore, my brothers and sisters, you also were put to death in relation to the law through the body of Christ so that you may belong to another… (Romans 7:4).\n\nTo be a Christian means that we belong to Jesus. And He belongs to us. Our sin was there on the cross. Our flesh was crucified with Him. And when He went to the grave to conquer death, He took our sin—our past, present, and still-to-come-future sin—with Him and buried it all there.\n\nAfter those three dead days had passed, Jesus came back, fully alive, and brought us, His made-new creation, with Him (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nI’m not a huge avocado fan, but I can see an object lesson when it’s before me. So I went to the grocery store, found two avocadoes that felt ripe-ish, and bought them. I didn’t have a plan—I just knew I needed them.\n\nI got home, sliced one open, and no kidding, the minute I saw the pit I started crying. Because I saw it, right there in the middle, the death that had grown life and sustenance. I pulled it out with a knife, washed it off in the sink, and just held it. And prayed.\n\nI asked God about all the avocado pits I see in my life, things that look dead. And I asked if they were ever going to grow into something that mattered. Did they matter? Did He even see them?\n\n…You belong to him who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God (v.4, continued).\n\nWhile the Holy Spirit whispered truth to me, I already knew it; I saw it there in the avocado. Of course, He sees it all. He alone brings life from death, even when it feels like no new fruit will ever will grow in those dry, barren places.\n\nI breathed a prayer of thanks. And then I made guacamole.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 7:14-25, Galatians 5:16-26, 1 John 1:8-10\n\nSure, I was terrible. But it was the fruit flies’ fault.\n\nI’d been at war with them all week, using every trick Google assured me would work. Bowl of vinegar mixed with dish soap? Done. A trap made of fruit and plastic wrap? Yep. Pour diluted bleach down the drain and hope for the best? Affirmative.\n\nI’d done all the entire internet knew to do, to no avail. The fruit flies were multiplying, not disappearing, and I was over it.\n\nI was trying to cook dinner, plotting against the irritating insects in the interim as the pasta boiled and the sauce simmered. I was annoyed—and not just at the state of my kitchen, but at what seemed to be the state of my life. Why couldn’t I just get it all under control already?  \n\nThat’s when David walked in.\n\nI married a good man. He is kind and gracious and funny. And when he walked in the door during my fruit-fly and general-life crisis, I did what any human being would do: I let him have it.\n\nI was as passive-aggressive as I knew how to be and then some. I started slyly with some innocent questions, and then I went in for the kill, attacking his actions and decisions and, in the end, his character. It was awful. I was awful.\n\nHere is what I cannot for the life of me understand: I had no desire to treat my husband with such unkindness and disrespect. I did not stand there in my kitchen, stirring that spaghetti sauce and thinking, When he gets home, I’m going to give him a piece of my mind. Honestly, I don’t know that I’ve ever thought that about him.\n\nI love David. And I love how he loves me. I want nothing but the absolute best for him. But my best intentions were not calling the shots that night. My humanity was.\n\nI’m so grateful for this passage in Romans 7. I’m grateful that God not only knows us fully, but He reassures us of this in His Word. I’m grateful for Paul’s confession that so clearly articulates the struggle I feel in my own heart on a daily basis.\n\nI don’t want to sin. Really, I don’t. But I do it anyway.  \n\nI want to obey the Lord. Really, I do. But I disobey anyway.\n\nPaul’s description of his own sin struggle in Romans 7:14-25 can seem confusing at first read. But read it again, slowly this time. Read it aloud. Do you hear the desperation? Paul, like me (and like you?), does not want to sin. But in and of himself—in his “flesh”—he does not have the ability to be sinless. And he seems pretty frustrated about this. I am, too. Aren’t you?\n\nSin is a disease we are born with but cannot heal. Sin is a slavery we are born into but cannot escape (Romans 3:23; 1 Corinthians 15:22).\n\nSin is a condition we cannot fix. But Jesus can. He has.\n\nThe message of the gospel of Jesus—the gospel that causes Paul to cry, mid-frustration, “Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (v.25)—is that Jesus has rescued us from “this body of death” (v.24). We are more than just our weak-willed bodies; we are souls who have been redeemed by the sinless life and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\n\nYes, we struggle with sin. We struggle to “keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:25), to choose a moment-by-moment life guided by the Spirit of the Lord rather than our selfish desires. But we do not struggle in vain. Our struggle is a fight—a fight to live in the freedom that has already been secured by the Savior who defeated darkness once for all (1 Corinthians 15:55-57).\n\nThanks be to God, for He invites us into a life governed not by our wants or our whims, but by His truth and love.\n\n",

And soft, two-ply toilet paper—that was even more rare. When I brought her home to Tennessee, flushing the toilet with copious amounts of Charmin quickly became one of her favorite pastimes.\n\nHow darling!\n\nThat was my thought in those early days as I observed her wide-eyed delight at watching massive plumes of paper spiral downward. But after a while, wading through ankle-deep wastewater in my bathroom and writing large checks to repairmen lost its allure.\n\nSo I was at my wit’s end a couple months ago when I walked into my bathroom—past my innocent-looking daughter splashing in a bubble bath—slipped on the wet tile, and quickly discovered water gushing out of the commode like Niagara Falls. After a heavy sigh, I morphed into the put-upon persona my mother used when I did something especially naughty as a child:\n\nDoggone it, Missy, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU not to use giant gobs of toilet paper like this?!\n\nI angrily set about cleaning up the mess. The entire time I was plunging and fussing and mopping up that yucky pond with beach towels, I had my back turned to Missy.\n\nAs the water and my irritability subsided, I turned around to see my precious little girl staring at me mournfully, big tears streaming down her beautiful brown cheeks. I’d all but crushed her spirit over something innocent and insignificant. She wasn’t trying to cause a mess. She hadn’t been willfully disobedient or disrespectful. This was a plumbing issue—not a heart issue.\n\nI lifted her out of the tub, dried her off with our last dry towel, and rocked her back and forth until she stopped crying. I carefully explained that it was wrong for Mama to raise her voice, that I’d made a very bad choice, and that I was so sorry I’d hurt her feelings.\n\nThat night I called my contractor, who seemed perplexed when I asked, “Hey, Jack, you know those really powerful toilets on cruise ships that sound like they could suck your leg off when you flush them? Can you install one of those in my bathroom?”\n\nLess than forty-eight hours later, our brand-new supersonic vacuum version of a toilet was installed. I cheered so enthusiastically after Missy’s inaugural flush, you’d have thought she’d won an Olympic medal.\n\nOur recent toiletastrophes have reminded me just how much I love, value, and cherish my little girl. They’ve also reminded me of how God the Father loves, values, and cherishes me, His kid.\n\nI’m overwhelmed by the beautiful, redemptive ways He’s moved in my life. How He chose a former Haitian orphan, who lost her first mom to AIDS and never knew her biological father, to effectively rip out the last stubborn roots of the orphaned, fatherless spirit that have been growing in my own heart since long before I was Missy’s age.\n\nFor those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory\n\n(Romans 8:14-17, NIV).\n\nChildren. Heirs. Coheirs with Christ.\n\nGod continues to employ my unlikely, only-by-grace, position of motherhood as a constant, colorful illustration of how He cheers Himself hoarse over every ungainly cartwheel we do (Zephaniah 3:17). How He leans down and hangs on every word of our mostly narcissistic prayers. How—despite our proclivity to make huge messes—He is so completely for us.\n\nLisa Harper is a master storyteller with a masters of Theological Studies from Covenant Seminary. She’s lauded as an engaging, hilarious communicator as well as an authentic and substantive Bible teacher. She’s been in vocational ministry for 30 years and has written 15 books (her latest being, The Sacrament of Happy: What a Smiling God Brings to a Wounded World) and Bible study curriculums but says her greatest accomplishment by far is that of becoming Missy’s (her adopted daughter from Haiti) mama!

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebekah Lyons\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 8:18-25, Isaiah 65:17, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Revelation 21:1-6\n\nIt begins as far back as we can remember. Right before we run off to school, we smear on our mama’s lip gloss and clamp down as many hair clips as our endless bangs will allow. We hope for another attempt to fit in with the others, to measure up, to belong.\n\nGrowing up, I often found myself hanging in the balance between enjoying the moment and anticipating the next one. As a young child, my hopes centered around a 25-cent soft serve ice cream cone after church on Sunday nights. My hopes matured as I did—working to make the swim team, racing to the finish line at a track meet, striving to win an award. I hoped for slumber party invitations, a certain new sweater for Christmas and, of course, beating my brother at checkers.\n\nThose early years of putting my best foot forward, I hoped the appearance of having it all together would win me friends. But years down the line, the stakes of life loomed larger, and deep heartache entered in—nevermind the lip gloss or hair clips.\n\nIn truly tragic moments, our hope is put to the test. And if it’s misplaced, it will be found wanting. \n\nThe hope we read about in Romans offers us a greater understanding of the hope God offers. It takes us from tangible evidence we can see, and pushes us deeper into a faith that asks for what we cannot see. In fact, all of creation is wired for this. If something breaks, we are hardwired to figure out a solution. Most problems can’t be solved in a day, so we work and test and try until we receive the desired outcome. But there will always be a hope offered by God that requires all of Him, and no amount of our working and testing will bring it to pass. This is the hope of Christ, our Rescuer and Redeemer.\n\nBecause of Christ, we are free to hope in even the most difficult or uncertain circumstances. In the first chapter of his epistle, James tells us to “consider it a great joy” whenever we face trials because the testing of our faith produces spiritual endurance (vv. 2-3). Trials are accompanied by hope. Hope is a gift. Hope is critical, and the gospel gives it to us in unending supply.\n\nNow in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience (Romans 8:24-25).\n\nAny suffering we endure here and now is incomparable to God’s coming glory (Romans 8:18). The measure of trials we have endured directly relates to the measure of hope we offer the world. This is the beautiful gift of hope.\n\nOne day our groans will give way to glory. While we wait, we place our hope in Jesus.\n\nHe will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away (Revelation 21:4).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 8:26-39, Psalm 44:17-22, Philippians 1:6, 2 Thessalonians 2:14\n\nI hope your summer fun list includes a trip to an amusement park or two. Nothing gets the blood pumping quite like circling a track at 100 miles per hour while simultaneously crying, laughing, and screaming. That’s good stuff.\n\nBut before you fill the water bottles and load the kids into the minivan for a day of sweltering, screaming fun, I need to let you in on a secret your brain already knows.\n\nIt starts with a feeling sociologists call “museum feet.” It’s a phenomenon our brains experience when we’re in a big space like an amusement park or a museum. It’s a general sense of being lost or exhausted that comes from hanging out in such a large space.\n\n“Museum feet” could give park-goers a bad experience, causing them to leave the park and not return. But architects have learned that if they include a large visual landmark, we’re less likely to become overwhelmed. They’re looking out for us, and their bottom line, by ensuring we’re willing to stay on the grounds long enough to fork over the cash for overpriced lemonade and nachos.\n\nThink about it: Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World. Spaceship Earth at Epcot Center. The 150-foot “Big Wheel” Ferris wheel at Six Flags. Each offers their own brand of fun, sure, but they also give a reference point to come back to, something to focus on when we feel overwhelmed, overtired, or just over it.\n\nPaul never made it to Disney World, but he must’ve known a thing or two about feeling anxious, overwhelmed, or disoriented. Here, in Romans chapter 8, he shoots up a flare of truth for the believer to come back to every time we feel the same.\n\nAnd we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28).\n\nIf this is one of those feel-good verses that’s become so familiar you’re tempted to race past it—STOP. This is the mother lode, friends! If God can use all things for our good and His glory, nothing can knock us off kilter. He makes us sure-footed. It’s the kind of steady posture that caused Paul to restate the truth of Romans 8:28 for the church in Philippi.\n\nI am sure of this, that he who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus (Philippians 1:6).\n\nPaul is describing the process of redemption—that supernatural metamorphosis whereby God makes all things new. Paul was so anchored in the gospel that no wind could capsize him. That’s not new news, but this may be: the steadiness of Paul is possible for us too.\n\nGod’s promise in Romans 8:28 means He’s already at work, reshaping everything for our good. Tribulation, persecution, famine—God can redeem all of these and more (v.35). Nothing can stop the redemption process (vv.38-39). Not death, not life, not angels or rulers. Not this moment or all the tomorrows to come. Nothing can stop God from working all things for good—not even you.\n\nLife is big. It’s easy to feel lost or overwhelmed or like we want off the ride, but God’s truth anchors us against museum feet. The story of redemption gives us a point to come back to when we feel alone or afraid. The next time you feel overwhelmed, overtired, or just plain over it, look up. The same cross that steadied Paul in the face of unthinkable trials will steady you.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 9:1-19, Exodus 32:30-32, Ephesians 1:3-6\n\nYou’ve probably been there—that terrible moment when you feel like you’re watching a train about to wreck. Your roommate chooses to stay in a toxic relationship. Your child makes a series of self-destructive decisions. Your brother or sister persists in a state of total denial. Your friend walks away from God.\n\nHelplessness is a special kind of agony, especially when it comes to our loved ones. This is the agony Paul expresses in Romans 9 about the choices of Israel. Having had his eyes opened to the light of the gospel, Paul realizes with great anguish that many of his people—God’s people—have not awakened to the good news of Jesus Christ. Theologian N. T. Wright describes Paul’s reaction this way: “[Paul] was like someone driving in convoy who takes a particular turn in the road and then watches in horror as most of the other cars take the other fork.”\n\nPaul’s sorrow is so great that he would rather take their place: “I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the benefit of my brothers and sisters” (v.3). This chapter, then, is not a cold, calculating explanation of Israel’s history and fate. Instead, Paul is wrestling with the mysterious ways of God, and he doesn’t arrive at many neat and tidy conclusions.\n\nIn Romans 9, Paul engages some complex theological questions, but if we zoom in a bit and look at his heart, we might recognize our own. Most of us have walked in Paul’s shoes—grieving the rebellion, blindness, or self-destruction of someone we love. From Paul’s own wrestling with heartache, we can discern two spiritual principles:\n\n1. None of us can boast. None of us stands on moral high ground. God’s grace was not extended to us on the basis of human merit, but divine mercy. That is the principle Paul points to throughout the history of Israel: Isaac, not Ishmael; Jacob, not Esau. These men, these chosen ones who constituted the line of Abraham, were not selected because of their outstanding moral character, but because of the free compassion of God. As Paul explains, “It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy” (v.16). In other words, none of us can pat ourselves on the back for our good choices or our strong faith, while silently judging others. It is all a gift, so that none of us should boast.\n\n2. God is sovereign. The relationship between God’s power and our free will is a mysterious one, indeed. But when it comes to the decisions of a loved one, God’s sovereignty removes a great deal of weight from our shoulders. Namely, we cannot force someone to make the right choice. We cannot yell someone into wisdom. We cannot wrestle someone into agreeing with us. And we cannot compel transformation. There is only One who directs the streams of human hearts, and that is God alone.\n\nThe sovereignty of God does not permit us to become callous, nor does it permit complacency. Like Paul, we should mourn destruction whenever we encounter it. But it can relieve us of a burden we were never meant to bear.\n\nOnly God knows the whole picture and the entire story. Our task is to share the good news to the best of our ability, in humility, and then prayerfully leave the rest to Him.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

The job was good enough; I coordinated summer camp logistics for kids interested in politics. Yes, it was as nerdy as you’re imagining, and yes, I was a former attendee. But the best thing about that summer wasn’t licking envelopes and herding hormones. It was meeting a new group of friends at church.\n\nI don’t know if you’re familiar with the town of Stars Hollow from the TV show Gilmore Girls, but those quirky, fictional characters had nothing on my new, real-life friends. Despite the fact that I was a stranger in town, and only planning to stay for eight weeks, they grafted me in, constantly hounding me to join them for weekend adventures of camping, floating down rivers, or taking long motorcycle rides through the Shenandoah Valley. It was as dreamy as it sounds, and healing for my soul in many, many ways.\n\nWe talked about the gospel, too, and one of those conversations led to the topic of the providence of God—what some call “predestination.” The candor of the conversation shocked me. Who talks about this stuff anyway? And what does the providence of God even mean?\n\nI was kindly pointed to today’s passage in Romans, and from there one friend explained the idea that God knows, plans, and orchestrates everything. All the days ordained for me (and you, for that matter) were written in His book before one of them came to be (Psalm 139:16). We are God’s workmanship created to do good works that He prepared in advance for us to do (Ephesians 2:10). Salvation itself is a righteousness that comes by faith, and even that comes from Him.\n\nAt face value, the concept that God is in control of everything might seem offensive. We humans have a cosmic authority problem. We don’t like to believe that Someone else has the final say in our lives. When Paul asks in Romans 9:20, “Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’”, I want to scream, “Yes! That’s what my prayers to God sound like on a regular basis!” But if we are to take Romans 9 to heart, we have to concede that God is ultimately the one in control of His creation.\n\nIn the years since my dream summer in D.C., I’ve learned a lot about faith. I’ve read much more of the Bible. I’ve spent countless hours with Jesus. And despite all that, God’s providence is as mysterious to me now as it was then. But I do know this: I would rather believe in a loving God who is fulfilling His purpose for me, than a cosmic universe that is inflicting its chaos on me.\n\nI look at the seasons, coming and going in their time. I look at the ocean waves, which know their boundaries. I look at my face in the mirror—imperfect, yes, but a masterpiece in the Master’s hands. I look at the miracles of birth and life and death. None of it is a mistake. This beauty is His creation, and He is sovereign.\n\nIf we trust Him—if we believe His love—we can put away our questions of Why did you make me like this? and put on the posture of Thy will be done.\n\n Claire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

I was a senior in college, involved in campus ministry and leading a Bible study, and I enthusiastically updated her on both endeavors. I’d begun telling yet another story when she calmly interrupted me with a simple, matter-of-fact statement: “You believe in a works-based gospel.” \n\nWe’d known each other a while, and her statement stunned me. Was she serious? \n\nI quickly brushed it off in the moment. But later that week, I found myself kneeling by the side of my bed, soaking my plaid, purple bedspread with tears. She was right. \n\nThere I was, wallowing in my sin, wanting desperately to be back in the loving arms of my Savior. I had asked for forgiveness, but the relief wasn’t coming. As I poured my guilty conscience onto the pages of my journal, I was struck by one word: time.\n\nThat’s what I thought I needed: time. I didn’t really want forgiveness. I wanted time—enough time to fill my life up with the right things, the good things, to settle the score. It was salvation by works at its worst. \n\nAll my striving, all my desire to put time between myself and my mistakes, it was another attempt to earn my salvation through my own effort. Rather than trusting the work of Christ on the cross for my righteousness, I had become dependent on my own actions to save me.\n\nI was living exactly like the Israelites Paul describes in Romans 10:\n\nSince they are ignorant of the righteousness of God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to God’s righteousness (v. 3).\n\nAfter Christ’s death and resurrection, Israel was still working hard to keep the Law of Moses in order to gain righteousness. They were working to save themselves, forgetting that “Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes” (v. 4). \n\nThe law, our works, the right things—they were never supposed to save us. God had planned our salvation and redemption through Jesus Christ all along. Christ is the only perfect fulfillment, the only victory we have over sin and death. His perfect life allows us to be justified through our faith alone. Faith and nothing else, just Jesus—this is the message of Christ.\n\n“For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (v. 13). \n\nAs I knelt beside my bed that day, I realized Jesus truly was all I needed. His sacrifice covered me then, despite all my striving, and it covers me today. I need His righteousness, not my own. He is enough. \n\nFriends, no matter what our past, present, or future holds, the only work that can save us is the work Christ completed on the cross. May we call on His name.\n\nOne believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation (v. 10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 11:1-24, Hosea 14:4-7, Ephesians 2:8-9\n\nThe first time I read Romans 11, I saw God as very kind. \n\nBut today, that kindness seems far away—30,000 miles below me, to be exact. This time, I’m reading Romans from seat 12B, squished between two strangers. And the pilot has just warned us that “significant turbulence” is ahead. \n\nA hush fell over the cabin in that awkward “I’m playing it cool” kind of way. Because it’s totally going to be fine. I mean, how likely is that whole “unlikely” in-case-of-an-emergency situation, anyway?\n\nWe’re all eyeing the flight attendants to gauge their uneasiness.\n\nJust when you’ve settled into your seat and become comfortable with God’s kindness, the winds shift. His tender mercies can also feel severe. Regardless of how much we show it, we’re all afraid of crashing.\n\nThe Romans were afraid of this too. After all, Israel had taken a hard fall following God’s rejection, so it only seemed natural for this band of new believers to begin bracing themselves for a similar emergency landing. They were afraid that if God didn’t turn out to be who He said He was, they’d have to take matters into their own hands. \n\nIt’s in moments like these that sweet songs about God’s kindness and goodness do not trump the truth about His severity. Just like we need the fullness of God’s character, we need to know the fullness of His Truth.\n\nAlthough the pilot reassures us that everything is under control, I’m tempted to entertain anxious questions. Did they check the plane to make sure it was safe before we boarded? Is the pilot keeping something from us? Is everything really just fine?\n\nWhen bad things happen that we don’t understand, are we just naïve to keep hoping? Will God reject us like He rejected Israel? It’s when we face the unknown that we find out how well we trust God’s character… which brings me to Jello.\n\nCreated by pilot and therapist Captain Tom Bunn to illustrate turbulence, the Jello Exercise compares a plane’s high-traveling, air-thickening speeds to being encased in Jello. While turbulent bumps may make you feel like you’re falling from the sky, it’s actually more like tapping the top of a Jello mold: the plane can bounce up and down, but it cannot fall. In fact, it barely moves at all. Regardless of the bumps, the plane is sustained, completely, by a force we can’t even see. \n\nSo are God’s people.\n\n“Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, though a wild olive branch, were grafted in among them and have come to share in the rich root of the cultivated olive tree, do not boast that you are better than those branches. But if you do boast—you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you” (Romans 11:17-18).\n\nIt is by grace that we cannot fully comprehend what it takes to sustain us. Not only does God know exactly what it takes, but in His kindness He sent Jesus to endure the severity for us. When love isn’t taken lightly, grace must also be severe.\n\nIt takes an intense, thickening wind to keep a plane steady in the clouds. It takes a kind, severe God to sustain us for His glory. Today, He is not only kind, but also severe, and exactly Who we need.\n\n“The people will return and live beneath his shade. They will grow grain and blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon” (Hosea 14:7).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 11:25-36, Isaiah 40:13-15, 1 Corinthians 12:4-11\n\nPerhaps you’ve heard the not-so-fairy-tale-like stories of the children of Israel. Like the one where God rescued them from slavery, and they responded by grumbling about the flavors missing from their menu (Numbers 11). Or the one where they got impatient with Moses as he met with God on Mt. Sinai, so they decided to worship a golden calf (Exodus 32). Or the time when they came to the border of the promised land and listened to their knees knocking and hearts racing, instead of listening to the voice of God (Numbers 13).\n\nWhen we flip forward in our Bibles to the New Testament, we find God’s people still stuck in the ruts of rejection and rebellion. It was, after all, the Jewish leaders who led the charge to have Jesus arrested, tried, convicted, and crucified (Matthew 26:3-5). After the resurrection, they remained resolute in their opposition of Jesus, doing everything in their power to squelch the message of the Church. \n\nYet here in Romans 11, Paul reminds us that despite their chronic grumbling and wilderness wandering, despite their golden calf worshipping and Savior scourging, the Jewish people remain God’s “beloved” (v. 28). \n\nOur human logic may balk at this, but Paul warns against trusting only what makes sense to our brains (Romans 11:25). Try as we might, we cannot understand God’s love using our flawed standards for love and acceptance. Chapter after chapter, verse after verse, the story of God’s commitment to His chosen people doesn’t make sense. Human understanding leaves us wondering, Why did God choose them? But through the lens of the gospel, the story of the Jews suddenly makes sense. Look at Deuteronomy 7:6-8.\n\n“For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth” (v. 6).  \n\nLean in. Listen closely to this next part. \n\n“It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all the peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath he swore to your fathers. . .” (vv. 7-8).\n\nGod knew His beloved were weak and frail—incapable of keeping their side of the covenant. Still He chose them, loves them, and keeps His promises to them. \n\nThe Bible is not the story of a wayward people but of a faithful God. \n\nIn the shadow of the cross, we are God’s chosen people. Because of the gospel, our identity has been changed from “not my people” to “my people” (Romans 9:25). Christ’s sacrifice made a way for us to be among the “beloved.” The gifts God has lavished upon us are so extravagant, and we are so undeserving, that we sometimes worry He’ll take them back. But “God’s gracious gifts and calling are irrevocable” (Romans 11:29). \n\nThe depth of God’s wisdom is matched only by the depth of His love. He has promised unfathomable gifts to us and He will never snatch them back. If every one of God’s acts of love and faithfulness toward the Jewish people could be contained, they’d overflow the seas. We, too, can stand on the shore and see the unmistakable faithfulness of God. \n\nWe are weak.\n\nWe are wayward. \n\nAnd yet, the Prince and the kingdom are irrevocably ours.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 12:1-8, Hebrews 13:15-16, Ephesians 4:1-16\n\nPersonal discipline isn’t one of my stronger giftings. To put it another way, I stink at it.\n\nI’m the one in my family who excitedly asks, “Who wants to go get ice cream?” rather than stick to our sensible meal plan. I’m notorious for drafting a shiny new routine that lasts for three days before I’m ready for spontaneity again. Despite my best efforts to implement structure in my life, I’m all over the place. I’ve come to accept that flexibility is just part of who God made me to be.\n\nBut here’s the truth. For me, that acceptance spills over into a lack of spiritual discipline. The world tells us that fulfilling our every desire or whim in the moment is a sign of happiness, success, and freedom. But I can say from experience that ignoring spiritual disciplines only leads to chains, not freedom.\n\nPaul warns us, “Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,” and I find myself staring longingly at his words (Romans 12:2). I want that. I want my body—my whole self—to be “a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God” (v. 1).\n\nI tried renewing my mind by attending church, but I didn’t make time to engage with God at home. I’d sit half-dazed in front of my computer, reading about fall fashion trends rather than reading my Bible. I’d watch one more episode of my favorite show and skip my prayer time. I wanted to read my Bible and pray and live out Romans 12:2, but my propensity for distraction and gluttony grew. I couldn’t control them on my own, no matter how guilty I felt or how many times I vowed to change.\n\nI’d forgotten that only God can transform my heart. And that transformation takes place in the context of the body of Christ, His Church—not just out here on my own, accompanied only by my best intentions.    \n\nMaybe your struggle is the opposite of mine, and routine and productivity are the desires that take the place of true renewal. Or perhaps your days are bound by a structure that you don’t want God to bend, a rigidity where spending time with Him in Scripture and in prayer are items on a checklist rather than intimate interaction with your heavenly Father. Whatever your personality, spiritual disciplines are tools that lift our eyes from our circumstances and desires and focus our hearts on God’s presence. Prayer, fasting, Bible study—they’re all disciplines that renew our minds and refresh our spirits. But unlike a resolution, a diet, or an exercise regimen, they aren’t sustained by our willpower.\n\nTrue spiritual growth is rooted in the Spirit’s work in us, not in our effort. God is the Giver. We are the recipient. He empowers. We surrender. We do this individually, as God’s daughters and sons, and we do this corporately, as His children and Church.\n\nMay we truly worship the Lord today by offering Him our whole selves, surrendering our desires to His will and our efforts to His strength, “according to the grace given to us” (Romans 12:6). Amen.\n\nJill McDaniel is a northern girl who married a southern gentleman and settled in the Midwest.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 12:9-21, Matthew 5:44-47, 1 Corinthians 4:6-13\n\nReading Paul’s list of exhortations to the Romans makes me tired. Seriously. Rid your life of hypocrisy. Love deeply. Outdo one another in showing honor. Do not lack diligence in zeal. Share with the saints. Pursue hospitality. Live at peace with everyone…\n\nWith everyone? Really?\n\nDude. Paul. I need some coffee. And also, when am I supposed to binge-watch my TV shows?\n\nIn all honesty, when I compare my life to the lives of the disciples, I begin to see why Paul fills 1 Corinthians 4:6-13 with so much irony. I practically live like a queen compared to Christ’s beloved friends back in the day, and compared to much of the world today. Most of my time is spent concerned about how I’ll choose to spend my time.\n\nI catch myself daydreaming about the life the world tells me I should have: a life with a passionate (never rocky) marriage to my soulmate, a clean and immaculate house, a career that’s advancing, children that are thriving, and plenty of time at the gym maintaining the body of a teenager. To top it off, the world tells me I need to portray this “perfect” life to the world on social media, to attract more followers.\n\nWith this world as my guide, adding Paul’s list to the mix is absolutely impossible. There are not enough hours in the day to do both what the world demands of me and what God desires for me. And so I have to choose.\n\nEvery single day I have to choose whom I will serve: my flesh or my God. Some days I make the right choice. Some days I make the wrong one. This is the life of a work in progress, one that God promises to bring to completion in His time (Philippians 1:6).\n\nPerhaps that’s why Paul tells us to “cling to what is good” (Romans 12:9). If good was an easy, simple thing to hold onto, why would he tell us to cling to it? I know that in my own life, if I’m not clinging to God, the natural inclination of my heart is one of jealousy, coveting, and destructive daydreams. So while it seems like what Paul is cautioning us to do should be obvious, I know it to be oh-so difficult to put into practice. Detest what is evil; cling to what is good. I know that If I’m clinging to something, then I’m desperate, grasping. I’m holding on for dear life.\n\nThese passages remind me that my very life is at stake, and that evil really is evil. Paul pokes at my carefully built life, reminding me that Christ’s path of goodness and stillness and quietness is the only route to peace. I can rest knowing that the battle is the Lord’s. But I can’t assume that rest and peace will come without effort on my part, without my choosing God. I must cling to Him and let go of everything else.\n\nDear Lord, help me to hold on.\n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 13:1-14, Daniel 2:19-23, Hebrews 11:32-40\n\nThe Bible is filled with the stories of people who have defied authority. Moses stood up to Pharaoh then led the Israelites out of Egypt. Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego all refused to worship any other god but Yahweh—and were then thrown into the lions’ den and fiery furnace, respectively. (Spoiler alert: God saved them all, and for His glory.)\n\nStephen defied the ruling Jewish Council, preached the gospel of Jesus, and was stoned to death for it. Paul and other apostles were martyred by the Roman government during the persecution of Christians.\n\nAnd yet this same Paul, who likely later died at the hands of his government, urges believers to honor and respect those in authority. Paul—who knew many examples throughout Jewish history of standing up to corrupt rulers—says to obey, seemingly without question. What are we to make of this?\n\nOf course, it’s natural to wonder, What if the government was urging murder, stealing, or some other form of not loving one’s neighbor? What if the ruling authorities were, as Nebuchadnezzar did, asking their people to bow down to another god? Or no god at all?\n\nScripture has given us plenty of evidence that Christ is the ultimate authority in heaven and on earth. Paul isn’t contradicting that here. What he is doing in Romans 13, is laying down a foundation for Christian living—reminding us that our ultimate authority is Jesus. Our first and truest loyalty is to Him.\n\nPeter gives a similar exhortation in 1 Peter 2. After telling the people, “you are a chosen race, a holy priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession” (v. 9), he says:\n\nSubmit to every human authority because of the Lord, whether to the emperor as the supreme authority or to governors as those sent out by him to punish those who do what is evil and to praise those who do what is good… Honor everyone. Love the brothers and sisters. Fear God. Honor the emperor (vv. 13-14,17).\n\nPeter starts by reminding believers of who they are: the body of Christ, a holy nation of God that extends beyond borders. This is a beautiful truth for us to cling to as well, especially in times of deep confusion, national partisanship, and turmoil within our own institutions.\n\nBoth Peter and Paul tell early Christians to honor their government, but they do so in the context of the whole story of Scripture (and their own writings), affirming that Jesus is Lord over all. Therefore, we obey the government when it doesn’t contradict God’s commands—and we do it joyfully, as a way of honoring God.\n\nJohn Piper says it this way: “And it is very important to stress that, just as we may have to disobey the civil authorities for Christ’s sake, so all our obedience should be for His sake as well. We never have two masters … Every time we say yes to any law, it should be a yes to Jesus.”\n\nOur every action should be motivated by our identity as followers of Christ and citizens of God’s kingdom:\n\nThe night is nearly over, and the day is near; so let us discard the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. Let us walk with decency, as in the daytime: not in carousing and drunkenness; not in sexual impurity and promiscuity; not in quarreling and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and don’t make plans to gratify the desires of the flesh (Romans 13:12-14).\n\nThe Bible offers many examples of what godly citizenship looks like in an earthly kingdom. Let us pray continually that we will seek first God’s Kingdom, listening to the promptings of the Holy Spirit as we engage thoughtfully with our own earthly governments. \n\nMelanie Rainer is the director of content for JellyTelly, where she writes and edits family spiritual formation resources.

Tonight my friends and I are headed to watch the Nashville Sounds play minor league baseball. There, I will hug everyone too many times, introduce friends who don’t already know one another, drink multiple Coke ICEEs, and maybe catch a foul ball. Then I will fall into bed tonight sure that I’m the luckiest woman alive.\n\nMy life is far from perfect. But the life I’ve spent 37 years putting together is turning out alright. Not perfect, not problem-free, but pretty awesome nonetheless.\n\nThe older I get, the more I draw boundaries in my life, making it the life I want to live. Some of my life rules wouldn’t work for you, and I’m okay with that. For starters, I’m dairy-free (it’s an allergy thing), but I wouldn’t ask you—or any of my friends at my birthday party—to live without milk, let alone eat cake WITHOUT ice cream. That beautiful stuff should never go to waste!\n\nThen there’s the matter of rest. My day off each week is almost always a Wednesday. That doesn’t mean it needs to be your weekly day to rest. It simply means Wednesdays work best for me.\n\nAnd then there’s the soccer. I watch it every chance I get. But you don’t have to do the same. Though, I’d highly recommend it because it’s just the best. Period.\n\n The beauty of maturing, and also growing up in my faith, is that I no longer want to look like you. In high school I wanted to look like you, sound like you, and like what you like. Not now. Now, I want to live MY life. I want to look like me—the best, healthiest, kindest, truest version of me. There’s this thing we get to do whenever we’re tired of comparing our lives to other people’s lives: we get to live our own.\n\n You know what it is? It’s the difference between bondage and freedom. Freedom is not a life without boundaries or borders or rule. It’s a life full of the good kind of boundaries, the kind that keep you healthy and strong, living the life God made you to live. It’s the life that is uniquely yours.\n\nFor none of us lives for himself, and no one dies for himself. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord (Romans 14:7-8).\n\nWe often think freedom as just wide open space. But I’ve never found that to be true. Real freedom is found in knowing Jesus. It is giving yourself permission to live wide open in the spaces where God has placed you and in the ways He has made you. My fences around my spaces are going to look different from yours, but there is such safety and health and permission inside the boundaries built just for you.\n\nScripture tells us that if we’re Christ-followers, then the life we get to live belongs to Him  anyway. Galatians 2:20 says, “The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.”\n\nThat right there—living for Jesus—is living your best life.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 14:13-23, 1 Corinthians 8:8-13, Ephesians 4:25-32, Ephesians 5:1-2\n\nI’ve always heard this passage in Romans 14 interpreted according to clothing, music, alcohol, smoking, and more—all in terms of “not being a stumbling block for others.” I was tender to my power to be a stumbling block of every sort, both to the believing and the unbelieving, checking over my shoulder to see the carnage I’d left in my wake. Truth was, I left hardly any, but it didn’t stop me from metaphorically cutting off arms and legs, gouging out eyes and the like, in pursuit of protecting my brothers and sisters.\n\nThe Christian life, I thought, was more about what I couldn’t do than what I could.\n\nHow glorious, then, when the true gospel began to take root in my heart. I began to understand that freedom in Christ meant I was truly free to live. As it turns out, Christ had declared me more than clean. He’d declared me redeemed.\n\nFor all the ways I’d formerly applied this passage, though, the one I’d not considered was food. I knew all food had been declared clean, that we’re no longer under the law of Moses in our dietary restrictions. But what I didn’t understand was the law of our current world with regard to food: the diet and exercise industry. Everywhere I look, the acceptable Christian message of caring for the temple of the Holy Spirit turns into what I imagine Paul might’ve called the “god of the belly” (Philippians 3:19).\n\nIn Philippians 3, Paul warns of the dangers of gluttony. But today, in modern culture, the opposing god—though a no less despicable one—is the one who demands less food, more restrictions, better supplements, flatter stomachs, tighter abs, and the list goes on. In an attempt to care for the temples of the Holy Spirit with eating and exercising, we can destroy our bodies (which are wasting away, whether we like it or not) and cause harm to the impressionable hearts and minds of others who jump on every new regime or diet we offer.\n\nWe want to be well, to eat healthy, whole, good food. We love the rhythms of feasting and fasting we see in Scripture. We want to move our bodies, staying limber and active. But we don’t want to destroy our hearts by lusting after what we don’t have: slimmer physiques and sculpted thighs. We don’t want to destroy our bodies by rebounding from one quick-fix supplement to another. We don’t want to destroy our minds by believing our approval comes from certain lifestyles or appearances.\n\nThere are countless difficulties in life, opportunities to be divided over race, gender, theology, and history. And food, instead of becoming a means to crush those divides—to draw near to one another, armed with soups, fruits, breads, vegetables, and meats—has become one more line of division.\n\nChrist died for all; this is what the Bible says. I don’t want to be known by what I eat or don’t eat. I want to be known by how I love and Who I’m loved by.\n\nSo then, let us pursue what promotes peace and what builds up one another. Do not tear down God’s work because of food (Romans 14:19-20).\n\nWhatever struggle you’re caught in the throes of today, know that you are loved by Christ. He spread His own body, bleeding and broken, to fit a cross you could never bear on your own. Don’t destroy your own body by what you do or don’t eat. Christ died for all—every curve, every bulge, and every stretch-mark—all of it.\n\nFor “the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit” (Romans 14:17). God gives us food as a means of provision, not division. Instead of fostering false divisions today, let’s bake a cake, make a soup or a sandwich, and share it with someone in the pursuit of peace.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 15:1-21, 2 Samuel 22:50-51, Psalm 117:1-2\n\nSome of my fondest memories as a kid include long summer days spent at the pool. These memories are filled with flipping off the diving board, shouting “Marco Polo,” and of course, playing King of the Mountain. The goal of King of the Mountain was to be the only one on top of the raft, ruling your kingdom by any means necessary. Growing up with brothers, I had to be scrappy and strategic to win at this brutal game. From a young age, I learned that only the strong survive.\n\nI’m told that as a grown-up, it’s not cool to push people off rafts at the pool. The thing is though, we still want to be on top. We just have different rafts now, and we’ve learned to defend our turf in more covert, “polite” ways. \n\nSo much of how we respond has to do with the season we’re in. When we’re treading water, we hope and pray for a gracious hand to help us onto the raft. But when we’re on top, it’s easy to become prideful in our position. It gets especially ugly when we believe there isn’t enough room on the raft for everyone. Even in the Church, we can foster the belief that the kingdom of God only has space for the “good” people, whether we’re conscious of it or not. \n\nIn our reading for today, Paul was writing to a Roman church comprised of two very different people groups: the Jews and the Gentiles. Even from its earliest days, it seems there were divisions amongst the believers in that region. Those who were “strong” didn’t want to help those they considered weak. But Paul challenged the Romans to accept one another, just as Christ had accepted them (Romans 15:7).\n\nPaul points out that even the strongest among us, Jesus Christ, did not use His power to please Himself. If anybody had a right to boast it was the Lord, yet He took our weakness upon Himself to the point of sacrificing His very life. \n\nWe are all in need of God’s grace. In that humility we can seek to be like Jesus, freely passing on the strength and encouragement that has been gifted to us. If the Lord of the universe humbled Himself and bore our weaknesses, how much more eager should we be to do the same for those whom He’s placed around us?\n\nIn addition to following the sacrificial example of Jesus, Paul also calls the Roman church to accept one another for the glory of God. When we’re competitive and exclusive in our churches, how do you suppose we’re seen from the outside? Our witness is compromised by our selfishness. But if we’re a countercultural people and can demonstrate with love and sincerity that there is room at the table of God, then we will have something divinely different to offer.\n\nIt’s tempting to believe the lie of this world, that we must fight to be on top. But in the kingdom of God there is always enough for everyone. As believers, we’re called to lay down our lives for others just as Christ did, to love both the strong and the weak. If we stop trying to protect our little rafts, together we will glorify and join in celebration with the one true King, who lives and reigns over all the mountains. \n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

I think constantly about what works and what doesn’t. In short, plans are my jam.\n\nIn my final year of seminary, a job opportunity arose. It was one of those really great, safe jobs that worked in all the practical ways. I would have a plan—in case, you know, God didn’t come through. I walked through the interview process until the final meeting, when we were to discuss terms for my employment. That morning I confessed to God that I was more concerned about my five-year plan than His plans for me. Then I did what I knew I had to do: I walked into that last interview and said, “This is just not where I need to be.” \n\nAt first, I felt amazing, like that scene in The Devil Wears Prada where Anne Hathaway throws her cell phone into the fountain. Life felt extraordinary, like I was jumping off of the proverbial cliff of my ordinary, planned-out life into the unknown. Later, as I sat alone, it hit me: I had no backup plan and only a few months until graduation. Panic set in, and I did what most of us do in crisis. I told absolutely no one that I was struggling.\n\nOne Sunday, my friend Laura cornered me at church. She barely had to acknowledge the look on my face before I spilled my doubts and fears of being a failure and a fool. I felt shame. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t even know how I was going to buy groceries that week.\n\nLaura didn’t miss a beat. She saw past the facade and grabbed my arm, looked me in the eye and said, “I don’t have an answer for you. But I can tell you that God is with you. Even when you can’t believe that, I’ll believe it for you.” Laura reminded me of the blessing that is mine as a follower of Jesus—a peace greater than my plans. \n\nPaul’s life was filled with adventure and excitement (think: shipwrecks and jail time) but he, too, was created for community. In Romans 15:23-24, he writes, “I have strongly desired for many years to come to you whenever I travel to Spain. For I hope to see you when I pass through and to be assisted by you for my journey there, once I have first enjoyed your company for a while.” In these moments we catch glimpses of Paul’s ordinary life, even in the midst of extraordinary journeys. \n\nI imagine he felt lonely at times. I wonder if part of him didn’t want to admit his own struggles. \n\nIn a moment of need, I didn’t even have the words to ask my friend to pray for me. But Paul’s letter reminds me that gospel community is the life we’re called to. Paul knew firsthand that when we experience fellowship within the body of Christ, we are experiencing the very kingdom of God. “I know that when I come to you,” he said to his fellow believers in Rome, “I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ” (Romans 15:29). Then he asked for their prayers. \n\nMay we be a people who confess aloud how much we need Jesus, and push one another back into His presence. We don’t simply write postcards from a distance and wish one another luck or prosperity. No, we have the honor of inviting each other to encounter the living God, the giver of salvation and peace.\n\nMelissa Zaldivar is a social in the world of academics and an academic in the world of socials.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 16:1-16, John 13:16, 1 Peter 5:14\n\nOf all of the roles I’ve had in my life, my least favorite, without a doubt, is “new girl.” \n\nShe’s clumsy and uncertain, always draining her phone battery with GPS directions to the grocery store and back home again. With brave intentions and shy tendencies, she’s perfected the art of introducing herself, yet allows her next-door neighbor to call her the wrong name yet again. She doesn’t know when trash pickup is or where to find the office break room. And her best friend, states away, knows she’s always on call for both late night and early morning pep talks.\n\nI’ve been the new girl enough times to know what makes her feel welcome. Paul has a pretty good idea, too. After all, he could have easily ended the book of Romans with chapter 15, one of the biggest mic-drop opportunities of all time. Instead, he reintroduces us to the gift God gave us in each other. \n\nAfter “amen,” Paul continues on with a crucial reminder: we are not alone. He introduces us to his friends by name, explaining their significance and telling us why we’ll love them. \n\nPhoebe, whom Paul reminds us is already our sister, is on her way to Rome (and may be the one carrying his letter!). He encourages us to befriend her and take care of her during her stay. Priscilla and Aquila, more dear friends, put themselves on the line for our buddy Paul. So, of course, we’re honored to greet them and their church. The list goes on and on, and as it grows, Paul continues to build up God’s people with encouragement, delivering each name as a lifeline to the full body.\n\nIn this intimate portrait of Paul and his fellow believers, we see a lasting truth: The body of Christ is a built-in reminder that redemption is an extraordinary reality for everyday people. \n\nIt’s easy to misread the Bible as “The Book of People Who Had It All Together,” when really, there’s only one Hero in this story. The simple truth is that we all need Jesus, and we all need each other. \n\nIn Romans, Paul emphasizes that God’s plan is good news. But his writing isn’t just for well-versed theologians—it’s for ordinary, faithful people living in small, unseen obedience. It’s for us. If you are in Christ, your name is written there among the greatness and glory of God’s plan.\n\nHere in our temporary home, we never stop being the new girl who needs to relearn grace and remember truth. But praise the Lord—we don’t have to do it alone. \n\nGreetings, friends. And peace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus (1 Peter 5:14).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 16:17-27, Matthew 7:15-20, Jude 24-25\n\nI took a personality test the other day, and I wasn’t thrilled with the results. It confirmed what I already knew: I avoid conflict like the plague. Put me in a tension-filled room and I’ll moonwalk away so fast, you’ll never even know I was there.\n\nI tell you this not to confirm that I was raised in the 80s (which I was), but so you’ll understand why I so desperately want to misinterpret today’s passage from Romans. I’ll show you what I mean.\n\nHere we’ve come to the close of the longest of Paul’s letters. We’ve heard him preach on sin and salvation, grace and faith, and now we’re leaning in to see how he’ll land the plane. What does one say to wrap up what would become known as the most comprehensive expression of the gospel in all of Scripture?\n\nHe begins his conclusion with a warning:\n\nNow I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who create divisions and obstacles contrary to the teaching that you learned. Avoid them… (Romans 16:17).\n\nThis is where my comfort-loving ears perk up. Steer clear of those who cause problems? Avoid conflict at all costs? If that’s what our friend Paul is selling, I’m buying in bulk. But he continues:\n\n…because such people do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites. They deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting with smooth talk and flattering words (v. 18).\n\nNo smooth-talkers allowed? Yep, works for me.\n\nIn my humanity, I want Paul’s words to leave me right where I am: a well-intentioned gal who doesn’t like to rattle or be rattled. I want a divine endorsement for a head-down, hands-off way of living. I want to look to the folks on my right and my left and say, I’m fine. You’re fine. Everything’s fine. In short, I want to read Paul’s words as permission rather than admonition.\n\nHe keeps writing:\n\nThe report of your obedience has reached everyone. Therefore I rejoice over you, but I want you to be wise about what is good, and yet innocent about what is evil. The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you (vv.19-20).\n\nCrushing evil is not a passive activity. Our holy and sovereign God is currently and constantly at work, overcoming darkness with light (John 5:17). As Christ followers, our work is not passive either. We are called to right doctrine and right living—to cling to Christ and to His gospel, shunning all false gods and gospels that beg our worship. This is Paul’s parting reminder.\n\nIt’s true that I’m predisposed to being a coaster—a person who’d rather stay the course than question questionable coordinates. But the gospel Paul presents in this letter is not a matter of right or left. It’s a matter of life and death. The mystery of Jesus Christ has been “revealed and made known through the prophetic Scriptures, according to the command of the eternal God” (Romans 16:26). Our Savior has come. He has opened the way to God, the rescue and restoration of our wrecked, restless souls.\n\nThe truth is, you and I are not fine. We “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). But in God’s great love and compassion, we have been “justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Romans 3:24). What’s more, “since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). \n\nThis is the gospel. This is our hope. \n\nThis is what we cling to, what we live by, what we fight for—to the glory of the One who created us, saved us, and calls us His own.\n\nTo the only wise God, through Jesus Christ—to him be the glory forever! Amen (Romans 16:27).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Daniel’s Captivity in Babylon",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nLast week my husband called to say goodbye to his 93-year-old grandmother. Her body is showing signs of fatigue, and her doctors have said she doesn’t have much time left. More than that, she can just sense it somehow.\n\nHe relayed the conversation to me afterward—how he told her would miss her, and how she said she loved him and called him “Doo-bug,” the name she gave him when he was a baby. I listened, the familiar ache in my chest of knowing that our time here is temporary, no matter how we like to pretend it isn’t. What must it feel like to know the transition to heaven is near—to look back over nearly a century of celebration and sorrow, wars and babies, grandchildren and church potlucks and conversations on the front porch? What does success look like from that vantage point? What does it mean to live a faithful life?\n\nIn the book of Daniel, we get an overview of one man’s life. This true story begins with God’s people, including young Daniel, being taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon (Daniel 1:2). Part of the king’s strategy was to take some of the most beautiful, wise, and noble into his own home and indoctrinate them in the ways of the Chaldeans. The Babylonians’ desire was to change everything about Daniel, from his name to the god he worships.\n\nThe book recounts Daniel’s roughly seventy years in exile. He will be a prophet, an interpreter of dreams, and a prisoner. He will fast, worship, and pray to the God of Israel under threat of his life. He will survive a den of hungry lions by Yahweh’s power and presence, and prophesy the glory of God’s eternal kingdom. And while we know Daniel was not perfect—he was human, a sinner in need of grace—we will get glimpses over these twelve chapters of what it looks like to live a faithful life in exile.\n\nWe, too, are exiles in this world, longing for the day when we will live at home in the presence of Christ our King. We are citizens of heaven, but we take up residence here for a time, called to represent God’s image on every stretch of the journey. As we wrestle with what it looks like to live a faithful life, we look past Daniel to the perfection of Jesus Christ. He is our example and our advocate, our just judge and righteous ruler.\n\nTo say this year has been disorienting is an understatement. But regardless of our times, our culture, or our circumstances, our God’s faithfulness endures and His character does not change (Hebrews 13:8). He is more than able to be our anchor in times like these. If we will turn to Him and choose His ways, He will help us to remain faithful in this life, looking forward to the day when we will no longer feel the exile of this world because we will be with Him in His eternal kingdom.\n\nLong live the King.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Alena Pitts\n\nDo you ever wonder what it means to be favored by God? Or do you ever think about what it looks like to have God’s hand on your life? I thought I knew, but the longer I live the more I realize my understanding of God’s favor is expanding.\n\nAt the age of ten, God granted me the opportunity to star in a Christian film called War Room. The movie was a box-office hit and has been viewed by millions of people all over the world. Two years later, God gave me the chance to write a three-book fictional series with my mom titled Lena in the Spotlight. Those books have sold thousands of copies all over the world as well.\n\nThese were two life-changing events that gave me the privilege of traveling all over the world to tell my story and share the hope of God. Now, at sixteen, I can easily look back and call that God’s favor.\n\nBut I need to be truly transparent and honest with you. When I was asked to write on this passage in the book of Daniel, I immediately felt unequipped and unworthy because there is more to my story.\n\nTwo years ago my beautiful mother unexpectedly passed away. She was my best friend. She was with me on the movie set, in my writing, and as I traveled sharing my story. Just two days before she died, we were speaking at a mother/daughter conference together. But then she left this earth really suddenly and entered into eternity. I was devastated. It was the most painful day of my life by far, and I still carry it with me.\n\nBut would you call me crazy if I called this God’s favor on my life? I wouldn’t have said that two years ago, but now I’m beginning to understand favor a bit differently, maybe more deeply.\n\nThink about it. Do you think Daniel wanted to leave his home country of Israel? Do you think he would have wanted to live in a land that wasn’t his, working for a king that wasn’t his, being asked to serve a god that wasn’t his? I imagine he was pretty saddened by how his life had changed so quickly. But with the blessing of time and perspective, we can see in our readings today how God’s favor was still with Daniel in all of that.\n\nAs devastating and heart-wrenching as reality can be, it can often be God’s favor. God’s favor could be anything He has done or allowed in your life in order to fulfill His ultimate purposes. And what is God’s purpose? That people would find Him in the midst of their lives, in their pain and struggle, and come to know that they are deeply loved by Him.\n\nWhat if, like Daniel, God wants to use your story to help others find Jesus? What if His favor can be found in the things that feel like blessings, as well as the things that are really hard? What if He wanted to use all of your life to show up in your story and lead others home to Him? Would you choose today to view all of it as His favor, working to fulfill His good purposes?\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nWhen my husband and I were debating where to attend grad school, I kept one prayer on repeat: “God, please make it abundantly clear where we should go.” I would have paid anything to know we were making the right decision as we logged thousands of miles on our car, traveling from state to state, and weighing pros and cons. Ultimately, God answered our prayer, just about as clearly as we could have hoped, and off to the midwest we went.\n\nBut I can count many, many more times in my life when I desperately prayed for a clear answer, and it felt like God met me with quiet and silence. Sometimes, God’s quiet feels empty and leaves me angry or desperate for answers. And sometimes God’s quiet feels like confidence, the kind of stillness that settles over a dark house at night, when you feel safe and at peace, but there is no sound.\n\nThe desire for a dream to be interpreted or for a sign to be made clear is everywhere in Scripture. Saul lost his kingship because of it (1 Samuel 13), Gideon tested God in a search for clarity (Judges 6), and even the Pharisees asked Jesus for a clear sign (Matthew 12).\n\nIn Daniel 2, King Nebuchadnezzar wanted a clear interpretation of his dream, and threatened all the wise men, magicians, seers, and sorcerers with death if they couldn’t provide him with that interpretation. Nebuchadnezzar was so troubled by his disturbing dreams and so desperate for answers, which we see in his willingness to reward or punish those who could potentially unlock it for him.\n\nBut no one could—no mystical prophet of the pagan gods, no wise man, no medium. The Chaldeans even declared, “What the king is asking is so difficult that no one can make it known to him except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals” (Daniel 2:11).\n\nBut Daniel, a wise man who knew the true and living God who did dwell with His people, had a different response. He called on the name of the Lord, who responded by giving Daniel a vision of both the king’s dream and its interpretation. Then “Daniel praised the God of the heavens” (Daniel 2:19), reciting a true and bold prayer, with promises still true for us today (vv.20–23).\n\nFor Nebuchadnezzar, for Daniel, and for us today—only God can unlock the mysteries of wisdom and understanding, because God is the true source of them. God answered Daniel’s prayer with abundant clarity, but He doesn’t always. Whether God writes His answer in the sky or (by our limited human understanding) seems to remain maddeningly silent, we can move forward with confidence and faith. The rest of Daniel’s story will testify to this truth and call us to a deeper knowledge of the God whose answers we can always trust.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jen Yokel\n\nIt was a matter of life and death. A recurring dream disturbed King Nebuchadnezzar’s sleep night after night. He called for the Babylonian magicians and wise men to explain it, threatening them with execution if no one succeeded, but Daniel, a Judean exile known for his wisdom and dream interpretation, prayed until God revealed the answer. And one day, he made his appointment with the king.\n\nIt wasn’t exactly good news.\n\nEach night, the king dreamed of a colossal statue made of various materials, from a solid gold head to iron and clay feet. Suddenly, a stone breaks from a nearby mountain and collides with the statue’s feet, causing it to crumble. The stone then grows into “a great mountain [that] filled the whole earth” (Daniel 2:35).\n\n“Your Majesty, you are king of kings,” Daniel truthfully tells the emperor. “The God of the heavens has given you sovereignty, power, strength, and glory” (Daniel 2:37). But the statue is a grim prediction. Babylon is the head of gold. Other, lesser kingdoms will rise and fall. But God, the heavenly “revealer of mysteries” (v.47), doesn’t leave this kind of power in human hands forever. “The God of the heavens will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed” (v.44).\n\nDaniel is a book full of mysteries and symbolism, politics and miracles. Yet the core truth is hope for an indestructible kingdom built on justice and mercy. Over and over, Daniel’s humility and loyalty to the God of his forefathers is contrasted with the arrogance of kings. Though his gifts made him influential, we don’t see a man tempted to play the power game. You can imagine him walking through the palace, serving royalty, and telling the truth with a homesickness and hope in his heart that whispers, “Someday… Someday, God will make this right.”\n\nCenturies later, Paul, another gifted exile, wrote this from the shadow of the Roman empire: “Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, when he abolishes all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign until he puts all his enemies under his feet” (1Corinthians 15:24–25).\n\nPaul paints a vision of God abolishing any authority that isn’t His, even death’s. Every empire that rises will someday fall. A reign built on violence and power can never truly last before a new ruler comes and tears it apart. But we can trust that God is building a mountain to fill the earth. God’s kingdom has been inaugurated by Jesus’s death and resurrection, because after all, “The last enemy to be abolished is death” (1Corinthians 15:26).\n\nGod, revealer of mysteries, shares the kingdom’s secret through Jesus’s life and resurrection. Daniel only had part of the picture, but he still carried confidence in an eternal kingdom—one of peace, laying down your life for your friends, and pledging allegiance to the only King who will reign forever.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Delivered from the Fire",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Tameshia Williams\n\nCourage under fire. We often encounter situations that require us to stand up for our beliefs, even at the risk of loss. We speak up about an injustice. We blow the whistle on unethical behaviors at work. We refuse to endorse societal values that clash with the truth of God’s Word. We perform these acts of bravery, knowing they can result in loss of our jobs, our relationships, and even our social standing. The pressure to back down can be tempting.\n\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego understood this pressure and refused to let even the threat of death sway them. God had their complete trust; they placed their fate in His hand. When faced with the fiery furnace that was meant to be their death sentence, they declared, “But even if [God] does not rescue us, we want you as king to know that we will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up” (Daniel 3:18). What a bold proclamation from these three young men in the presence of such a powerful king! They chose faith in God over fear of a human king. No matter how intense Nebuchadnezzar made the fire, the young Jewish men refused to abandon their trust in the Lord.\n\nTheir story gives us a powerful picture of what unwavering faith in God looks like in our own lives. We trust that He is with us, no matter what flames we face. We trust in Him when we are sick, encounter financial hardship, and even lose our loved ones. He promises to be with us through it all (Isaiah 43:2). And so even when the king made good on his fiery threat, God proved that He had not abandoned His faithful ones (Daniel 3:25).\n\nThe Lord can also use our faithfulness to change people’s thoughts and actions in ways we cannot even begin to imagine. Nebuchadnezzar marveled at the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego after witnessing their delivery from the fire, acknowledging, “There is no other god who is able to deliver like this” (Daniel 3:29). Even further, he passed a law that forbade anyone else from speaking against God. This allowed other Jewish exiles to worship God without fear of punishment. This all came about because three young men refused to give up their faith.\n\nAnd what about us? How do we respond when it seems as if everything and everyone is against us? We lean in closer to the one who refuses to abandon us. We trust that as we walk through the flames, He is with us every step of the way.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitie Stoddard\n\nAt the core of our faith, we Christians believe that the Triune God is the one, true ruler of the universe. At least that is what we confess with our mouths. But if we’re honest, it’s not always how we order our lives, is it? If you don’t struggle with remembering that only God is God, consider yourself blessed with humility. But if you’re anything like me, it’s easy to slip into acting like you’re in control of your successes and failures—taking credit when things go well, spinning your wheels when things unravel.\n\nIt’s the original sin in the garden of Eden (Genesis 3), and the one that still haunts us today. When Eve grabbed the fruit, she grabbed at God’s throne. Despite the fact that she was living in paradise with her perfect mate, she wanted more. And we do the same: all too often, we grab at God’s power and we claim God’s glory.\n\nNot in an obvious way, though. Not like King Nebuchadnezzar who literally claimed he built Babylon by his “vast power” for his “majestic glory” (Daniel 4:30). Cue the eye roll. That guy was so full of himself, it’s hard to feel bad for him when he ends up eating grass (v.25).\n\nWhile we probably wouldn’t say anything that arrogant out loud, we harbor the same sin of pride in our hearts. Maybe that’s why things like the story of Nebuchadnezzar and the proverb’s warning that “pride comes before destruction, and an arrogant spirit before the fall” (Proverbs 16:18) always seem to spook me a little; because I know I’m a sinner, and I don’t want to wind up eating grass too.\n\nThank goodness, God is gracious. In His plan for Nebuchadnezzar, we see God intended to show the king mercy. God left the root intact when He chopped Nebuchadnezzar down like a tree. Daniel interpreted that to mean that God would restore Nebuchadnezzar as soon as he turned from his sin and proclaimed God’s rule (Daniel 4:26). This story is a reminder that God is more compassionate than we can imagine. Because we are covered by the blood of Jesus, “He has not dealt with us as our sins deserve” (Psalm 103:10).\n\nIn remembering God’s graciousness to me, I can’t help but remember what a better Lord He is over my life than I could ever be. We can serve our sinful selves or we can serve the most loving God. When we think about it that way, it’s an easy choice. God’s ways are so much better than our own (Isaiah 55:8–9). We can learn the hard way and find ourselves face down in the grass, or we can choose each day to proclaim the truth that “his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation” (Daniel 4:34). Therefore, “let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord” (1Corinthians 1:31).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey T. Hurley\n\nThe writing was on the wall: No matter how many clothes I purchased or how many beauty treatments I tried, I wasn’t going to get the fulfillment I longed for by my outward appearance.\n\nI’m embarrassed to admit that I often want women to see me and covet my style, my hair, my home decor. As a woman who loves Jesus, I often put my self-identity in my image and how “put together” people perceive me to be. It’s not just the clothes though; it’s the ability to juggle everything, balancing kid schedules and my own free time. It’s the way I can host a big party and make it look effortless. I even want the God-given opportunities of ministry to look like I do it all on my own. Never mind the privilege and good gifts God provides. I am quick to forget whose glory I am actually seeking: God’s.\n\nKing Belshazzar, like myself, also struggled with humility. After he was given the privilege and honor of his new role as king, he chose to exalt himself “against the Lord of the heavens” (Daniel 5:23).\n\nBefore Belshazzar, King Nebuchadnezzar lost his throne when he became arrogant and forgot God’s favor upon him. One would think Belshazzar would have learned from his predecessor’s mistake, but it is not until Daniel interprets the message God had sent that Belshazzar realizes his misplaced glory. Daniel tells Belshazzar, “You have not glorified the God who holds your life-breath in his hand and who controls the whole course of your life” (v.23). Unfortunately, it is too late for him; Belshazzar is killed and his kingdom is handed over to the Medes and Persians (v.28).\n\nI can’t judge King Belshazzar for wanting the glory for himself, for forgetting who gave him the position of authority in the first place. It’s so easy to forget who controls the whole course of our lives when we are so focused on what we want, when we want it. It can be hard to see the big picture when the things of this world seem so attractive and promise us instant glory. But it is not the things of this world that deserve our attention and worship because they are all “passing away” (1John 2:17).\n\nIt is God’s glory—whose dominion and power are greater than the greatest kingdom and whose influence reaches far beyond the reign of any king—that deserves our greatest attention. We will all fail like King Belshazzar by exalting ourselves over God and forgetting to acknowledge His power and rule over our lives. But we are also covered by the grace of Christ, which moves us toward a posture of humility. Each day we get to repent and choose to acknowledge God and give Him the worship He deserves.\n\nForget the latest fashion; I can clothe myself in humility and trust God to “exalt [me] at the proper time… because he cares about [me]” (1Peter 5:6–7). This is a glory that outweighs the attention of others, one that never fades. It is everlasting life in the kingdom of God with a perfect, loving, and kind King.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Abby Flynn\n\nHave you ever been in a lions’ den?\n\nFor most of us, the answer is probably NO, but metaphorically, that might be a different story. What I’m really asking is this: Have you ever been in a situation where you felt trapped, without options or a way out? Have you ever felt betrayed by the people you trusted? Have you ever wondered if God is big enough to pull you out of that difficult thing you’re facing?\n\nIn Daniel 6, the entire nation of Judah was in captivity. These people probably often felt defeated, yet they clung to the hope and the promise of a coming Messiah to save them. \n\nIn the midst of this, Daniel, a Judean, is working for King Darius and gains favor with him. The king positions Daniel for advancement, but this leads to jealousy from the king’s other administrators (Daniel 6:1–5). They knew Daniel served the God of Israel, which was in direct opposition to what the king had commanded. So they convinced the king to put an ordinance in place that anyone who chose to worship another god would be thrown into the lions’ den (vv.6–9). But instead of worshipping in secret or putting his faith on the back burner, Daniel continued praying to God publicly, despite the decree. \n\nThree times a day he got down on his knees,  prayed, and gave thanks to his God, just as he had done before (Daniel 6:10).\n\nThis clash between faith and politics resulted in Daniel being thrown into the lions’ den, even though the king desperately tried to save him. Once inside the den, the king tells Daniel to call out to his God for help. You see, even Darius recognized that Daniel’s God was living and active, something he saw by observing Daniel’s faith. The next morning, the king comes to check on Daniel, only to find he’s miraculously unharmed! (vv.21–22).\n\nHere’s what this story shows us: No matter how dire things may look, there is NO situation created by man that God cannot change (v.17). There’s no principality, no power, no earthly ruler, or law greater than the one true God. The whole book of Daniel gives us constant reminders of God’s sovereignty. To this day, God is still a rescuer, deliverer, and miracle worker, even when circumstances are difficult.\n\nSo what are you having a hard time trusting God for? What is the seemingly impossible situation that you’re sitting in with no clear way out? The pressure may be on. You may not see a light at the end of the tunnel. But you can trust that the living God is in the den with you. And He has the ability to “shut the lions’ mouths” (v.22), whatever that may be in your life. \n\nLord, today we ask that you would remind us of the promises in your Word. Help us to focus our attention on You, instead of fearing the circumstances around us. Tune our hearts to the things you want to show us, even in the lions’ den. Even now.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Elaine Phillips\n\nThe first part of Daniel’s dream vision was the stuff of night terrors. The four apocalyptic beasts were fierce predators, each more terrifying than the previous one. The four parts of the statue in chapter two represented four kingdoms; now Daniel saw their true nature. These rapacious creatures embodied the four brutal super-powers under which God’s people would suffer—repeatedly. While the stationary image signified the idolatrous world views of the dark kingdoms, the violence of these beasts exposed the lawless end product of idolatry, no matter what form it takes. God’s people should rightfully quail at the prospect. \n\nFor that reason, the second part of the vision is of utmost importance—for Daniel’s audience and for us.\n\nThe Almighty God is on His throne. What words can possibly capture God’s radiant and holy presence? God is surrounded by fire and flaming wheels, with an accompanying river of fire. Fire purifies. Woe to us indeed, if we fail to bow our faces to the ground in appropriate fear and dread; “our God is a consuming fire” (Hebrews 12:28–29). \n\nWhat can convey God’s absolute and everlasting rule of the universe? That’s the point of “Ancient of Days” and blindingly white hair and clothing (see Psalm 104:2). We must linger on these words and images that catapult us to the vaults of heaven. Far above all else that we may find tumultuous and terrifying, God reigns supreme, and God will judge. Daniel saw the books opened and those utterly fearsome beasts either subdued or destroyed.\n\nThen, the Son of Man arrived with the clouds of heaven, was ushered into the presence of the Ancient of Days, and was given dominion, glory, and power (Daniel 7:13–14). Everyone would serve Him, and His kingdom would never end. In other words, the Son of Man is God. \n\nJesus intentionally chose this title for Himself (Matthew 8:20; 11:18–19). His audiences might first have thought of Ezekiel, whom God repeatedly summoned with the words, “son of man,” affirming the prophet’s human nature, entirely given over to serving God. But they would also be familiar with this passage. Daniel’s “Son of Man” was invested with all the accoutrements of deity. By consistently calling Himself “Son of Man,” Jesus was affirming and declaring that He is both fully God and fully human. \n\nThat culminated in the exchange between Caiaphas and Jesus (Matthew 26:57–67). When Caiaphas put Jesus under oath, Jesus declared they would “see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven” (v.64). This one bold statement drew together this passage from Daniel 7 and King David’s words from Psalm 110:1—two key passages Caiaphas would have been well acquainted with, both of which unquestionably point to God and no one less. No wonder those religious leaders at Jesus’s trial tore their robes! \n\nMake no mistake, Jesus was declaring Himself God before those religious leaders who should have been anxiously awaiting His arrival. Their human judgment of Jesus is an ironic contrast with the image of God’s coming judgment in Daniel 7:9–10. Nevertheless, in God’s cosmic judicial proceedings, those events affected true justice—for eternity.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Patti Sauls\n\nDeadly beasts, a boasting horn, a heavenly courtroom… what is happening? Are you bewildered by the strange details like me? If so, we’re in good company. Even Daniel was overwhelmed by his own vision. Daniel, the faithful Israelite. Daniel, the brave exile in Babylon. Daniel, the interpreter of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream. But even he couldn’t interpret this one. (Glad I’m not the only one confused.) Feeling terrified and exhausted, he asks an angel within the scene for an explanation. \n\nWoven into this account of Daniel’s vision is God’s reminder that it’s okay not to have all the answers. He gives us freedom to wonder and be uncertain. God invites us to prayerfully ask for help (Philippians 4:6–7) and to search for clarity (Psalm 119:12–16). However, the humbling reality is that we just won’t understand it all. For example, most scholars interpret the four beasts in Daniel’s vision as the empires of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, yet there is debate about which kings the horns represent, how the little horn specifically attempts to dominate, the timing of it all, and so on.\n\nThere’s a lot we don’t know, but there’s a lot we do know, too. We see these mighty empires puffed up with pride and self-sufficiency. They devour, crush, and trample as they oppress and conquer their neighbors (Daniel 7:19). What a picture of how humans behave like beasts when we reject our Creator! Individuals and societies disintegrate when we refuse to believe that every human is made in the image of God and deserves dignity. Seeking “my will be done” instead of “God, your will be done” diminishes our humanity. The ruthless kingdoms rise, then, inevitably crumble.\n\nThe angelic interpreter also tells Daniel that the ten horns represent kings who will rule after the fall of the brutal fourth kingdom. Daniel is especially horrified by another little horn that rose up to overtake the others. It represents a tyrannical leader who arrogantly rejects God, wages war against God’s people, and positions himself as a tyrant over all creation.\n\nYet, all is not lost. Horror gives way to hope as Daniel watches the ultimate reckoning unfold. A heavenly court convenes and God Himself, called the “Ancient of Days,” takes the judgment seat. The Judge rules; the verdict is in. All who have set themselves up against the authority of God are sentenced to eternal death. Then, one who looks like the son of man joins the Judge to accept the rule and reign of God’s kingdom of eternal life.\n\nWhile Daniel strained to see and understand this hope, we can look to Jesus, who called Himself “the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven” (Mark 14:62). Even though we don’t have all the answers, we can rest assured “that the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever, yes, forever and ever” (Daniel 7:18). World without end, from horror to hope… Amen!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nI’m always looking for a way to get out of work. Lately, a global pandemic has proven an excellent excuse for me to close up shop by noon to put my feet up while I indulge in existential worry and consider rearranging my indoor plants. Maybe you like to give up a little on your kingdom work, too, when the future looks bleak. But let’s consider that our callings remain vitally important in spite of whatever germs, climates, powers, or terrifying bugs may be buzzing around us.\n\nBiblical prophecy usually has at least two applications: one specific interpretation and one related, general, big-picture meaning. Sometimes the specific meaning of the prophecy is revealed soon after the prophecy, and sometimes thousands of years elapse before the meaning is clear. Looking back, some of these prophecies look really obvious, like: “Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign: See, the virgin will conceive, have a son, and name him Immanuel” (Isaiah 7:14). But at the time of Isaiah’s prophecy, an immaculate conception didn’t make any earthly sense. The prophet often doesn’t get to enjoy an understanding of the prophecy. Here, Daniel is given a very specific vision and an interpretation. But he still could not understand it. \n\nDaniel sees a vision of judgment for sin. He sees an angry ram and a violent goat and absurdly large horns. He sees the result of sin running rampant in a civilization. And he asks, just as we might ask, “How long?” (Daniel 8:13). How long will this last? And the “holy one” answers with a finite number. In this case it is 2,300 days (v.14), but notice the number is a real, countable number. The big picture is that sin is sometimes allowed to flourish—but not forever.\n\nThe whole ordeal appalls and overwhelms Daniel. Understandably. But here’s the part we should really notice in particular: He “got up and went about the king’s business” (Daniel 8:27). The scary news didn’t make Daniel give up. The confusing and difficult revelations did not prevent him from holding on to what he did know, what he did understand. He took a minute, and then he went back to work. He got on his feet and did the good work the Lord had called him to. He engaged in the culture and continued doing his faithful work.\n\nEven when we feel afraid, even when we look to the future and dread wells up in our hearts, we know the most essential truth: God is on the throne. This is His creation and we, the Church, are His Bride. The angel tells Daniel, “Son of man… understand that the vision refers to the time of the end” (Daniel 8:17). The “end” will come. The suffering in the world is limited and finite. But we never need to fear the end. Remember how Christ spoke to His disciples of the end times, saying, “Be courageous! I have conquered the world” (John 16:33).\n\nThough we may, like Daniel, be “overcome and lay sick for days” (v.27) when we look at the state of the world, and wonder how it can all possibly come to good, we are called to remember that God is busy at work. Therefore, we can rise like Daniel, and go about the business that God has set before us. We can be of good courage, knowing that the end of the story is not the triumph of wickedness, but the victory of Christ. Truly, we are more than conquerors in Christ who rules and reigns forever. So take heart, and go about your kingdom work.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Daniel’s Prayer",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nIn Shakespeare’s history play, Richard II, John of Gaunt mourns England’s degradation on his deathbed, intoning, “That England, that was wont to conquer others, Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.” The greatness of England was fading away because of its internal corruption. And this is the truth of all civilizations. They do not fall because of external attack, but they collapse from the corruption and rot festering on the inside.\n\nRepeatedly in Scripture, we also see the children of Israel making a shameful conquest of themselves. There will always be some battle raging, but it’s not a fight against governments and revolutions; the battle is spiritual. The battle is for and in our own hearts. In the New Testament, the apostle Paul arms himself with powerful weapons, urging us to: “Pray at all times in the Spirit, with every prayer and request, and stay alert with all perseverance and intercession for all the saints” (Ephesians 6:18).\n\nCenturies before Paul, Daniel relies on the same principle. The fulfillment of God’s promise to restore the conquered city of Jerusalem and its exiled people was at hand, and Daniel recognized that this providential showering of grace was an opportunity to fix all his hope on God. Israel had fallen to conquest precisely because it had walked in pride and unrepentance. It had rotted from the inside. \n\nDaniel’s prayer is not about self-reliance, or newfound worthiness to return to their homeland. He recognizes that righteousness belongs to God alone (Daniel 9:7). His grace alone, His provision alone is sufficient. He alone can root out the inward-rottenness and make us a new creation, a new nation, and a royal priesthood for Himself.\n\nDaniel prayed: “We are not presenting our petitions before you based on our righteous acts, but based on your abundant compassion. Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, listen and act! My God, for your own sake, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your name” (Daniel 9:18–19).\n\nLike Daniel, our focus must be on our continual need of God’s provision. He must lay conquest to our hearts, that we may not be given over to self-destruction. He alone is righteous and able to save (Daniel 9:7). And, like Daniel, we have this great comfort: He does save. He hears the cries of His people, and restores the inheritance of His saints. He does not leave us as orphans and exiles (John 14:18), but in His own righteousness, He mightily saves.\n\nThe restoration of Jerusalem was a foreshadowing of the restoration of Christ, who has made a glorious conquest of the human heart. He has conquered our hearts, and become our confidence, hope, joy, and strength are founded upon the unchanging and transforming righteousness of God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Elaine Phillips\n\nReality: “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this darkness, against evil, spiritual forces in the heavens” (Ephesians 6:12). \n\nReally? \n\nHow easily we find ourselves thinking that Twitter feeds, mindless sound bites, even whole paragraphs about presidents, protestors, politics, and pandemics are the substance of our realities. Turns out the apostle Paul did not think of reality so superficially. Neither did Daniel. \n\nLooking back 2500 years ago, international politics were dicey then too. The super power had shifted from Babylon to Persia practically overnight. There seem to have been crises at the top; the alternating names Darius the Mede and Cyrus leave a whiff of uncertainty, not just for puzzled commentators but possibly for real people at that time. \n\nDaniel was a venerable statesman—probably in his eighties at this point—when he chose to fast, humble himself, and seek greater understanding of the rapidly changing circumstances surrounding him (Daniel 10:2–3,12). He commenced these disciplines just prior to the festival of Passover, three years into the Persian rule. Perhaps he anticipated an immediate response in time to celebrate the Passover traditions of redemption from bondage. His previous prayer experience might have led him to expect it. Directly after the Persian takeover, he had prayed earnestly, and the angel Gabriel arrived in swift flight with an answer, even while Daniel was still praying (chapter 9). \n\nThis time was different. Three long weeks passed before the response came. In the meantime, Daniel likely did not eat the Passover meal or drink the cups of wine. When the vision did come, it was overwhelming. Daniel fell to his face before the linen-clad figure, who was wearing a sash of gold, had flaming eyes, a face like lightning, and a thunderous voice (note Revelation 1:13–15). \n\nThe messenger spoke of warring dark powers in the heavens, reaching their tentacles into every earthly turmoil. Evil and sinister “princes” underlay the destructive kingdoms of the Persians and Greeks, both of whom would oppress God’s people severely. The future trauma detailed in chapter 11 would occur more than two centuries after Daniel’s lifetime. Nevertheless, Daniel’s revelation here made it clear these tumultuous events were not outside God’s sovereign plan (Daniel 4:34).\n\nBack to our present: the brutal evil we see daily is an imprint of cosmic war; it requires vigilance and powerful prayer intervention. Hence, Paul’s admonition to put on the full armor of God and to stand, stand, stand firm. Daniel, a ”treasured” person, heard the same admonition: stand and be strong (Daniel 10:11,19). \n\nHow do we stand strong when lies incessantly rage and evil powers rear their ugly heads? “Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10) takes on another dimension, doesn’t it? We must stand against everything false and contrary to the knowledge of God, taking every thought captive to Christ (2Corinthians 10:3–5), ordering our lives by God’s truth, and praying faithfully that the burning arrows of the evil one will be extinguished.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nMy daughters were in Narnia for the first time this summer. Every night, they’d beg for the next chapter of C.S. Lewis’s beloved fantasy series. The spell has taken them in, totally, as we talk of Aslan and Lucy, of Reepicheep and Mr. Tumnus, of glory and dust, of past and future. Prince Caspian is the second book in the series, and its opening chapters read like a stop-and-start, future-and-past prophecy. The Pevensie children return to Narnia, and find themselves retracing their Narnian steps 1300 years after they left, though it has only been a year at home in England. Caspian, the titular character, knew the legends but never expected to find Peter and Susan and Edmund and Lucy and Aslan to come to his aid, restoring his place as rightful king.\n\nAs they struggle to grasp the reality of waking up in the ancient ruins of their once-glorious Cair Paravel, time shifts forward and backward in their minds. Could this be my sword? Peter wonders. Our table? Our home? Is this where we danced and played and ruled a beautiful, peaceful kingdom?\n\nHolding the tension of “the already and not yet,” the mix of grief with memory but also hope, is a benchmark of the Christian life, and I felt that familiar, yet somehow distant, feeling while reading Daniel’s third prophecy, in Daniel 11. Already living in exile, Daniel is given a prophecy of an even longer exile, while also clinging to the hope of the Davidic kingdom the Israelites had once known, longing for the time when they would finally leave exile and rebuild Jerusalem.\n\nDaniel’s prophecies were very real to his audience and to the Jewish people. They predicted events that would be fulfilled over the next four hundred years of Israel’s history—redemption that would come for a season and a people. But the redemption Daniel foresaw comes to us as well. We cling to the hope of something that was here once (Eden), and we know will one day come again (God’s fully restored kingdom). \n\nDaniel’s prophecies, especially here, are for us, too, as people of God’s already-and-not-yet kingdom. As believers with a future hope, we constantly experience the push and pull of kingdom living. Our hearts quicken to signs and wonders, reminding us of something that hasn’t happened yet, but we somehow miss and long for anyway. We are Prince Caspian, steeped in the ancient history of our beloved kingdom, but never expecting the good king himself to break into our present. \n\nBut when he does, it’s glorious. And that hope that Daniel prophesies and the rest of Scripture proclaims, is very real. God’s kingdom is everlasting, from generation to generation. Once, hundreds of years after Daniel’s exile, Jesus broke into the earthly realm and planted the seeds of God’s kingdom. And one day, He will come again, and bring with Him the full flourishing kingdom that our hearts were made to hope for.\n\n",

When I’m struggling, these words from the psalmist often echo in my mind. I was 15 years old when I learned about Jesus, began reading the Bible, and became a Christian. Now I look back on over thirty years of following God and finding Him faithful. Yet when I trudge through deep valleys of anxiety, conflict, or brokenness, I still often find myself doubting, wondering, Lord, do you see me? Do you care?\n\nDaniel’s visions were terrifying, and the suffering he saw was ongoing and global. He was given a weighty responsibility to witness and report such intense distress. Yet he was also given a powerful reminder of God’s promises. This gracious reminder is for us as well.\n\nAn angelic interpreter explained to Daniel, “Those who have insight will shine like the bright expanse of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever” (Daniel 12:3). What a strange thing to say, that God’s people would shine like stars. But the imagery was not lost on Daniel. He was a faithful Israelite, and this “star talk” would trigger the memory of God’s ancient promise made in the midst of another man’s vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield… Look at the sky and count the stars, if you are able to count them…. Your offspring will be that numerous” (Genesis 15:1,5).  God promised to grow and protect a vast nation through Abram’s family tree. Yet, as the years went by and his wife, Sarai, bore no children, Abram began to fear that God might not be true to His Word.\n\nLike Abram, Daniel was scared of the future. When would the distress give way to deliverance? “How long until the end of these wondrous things?” asked another witness in the vision (Daniel 12:6). Daniel didn’t get all the answers, but he did receive assurance that God was, and would always be, trustworthy. In remembering the stars, Daniel knew that God had not forgotten Abram. A son, Isaac, was born. God kept His promise to grow the nation of Israel through Abram’s descendants, and He changed Abram’s name to Abraham, meaning “Father of a Multitude” (Genesis 17:5). God proved Himself true to Abraham, and He would continue to be faithful to Daniel and all future believers.\n\nMaybe the stars can trigger our memory of God’s faithfulness too. God knows we can be confused by the world’s suffering and by our own pain. Like Daniel, we may be scared of the future. But God assures us He is “the Alpha and the Omega… the one who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty” (Revelation 1:8).\n\nThis is our trustworthy, unchanging, eternal hope. God established His people through Abraham’s son, and He protects and secures His people through His own Son, Jesus. God is with us: we are His people, and He is our God. We may forget God, but He does not forget us. He sees us, and He cares for us. Remember the stars.\n\nPatti Sauls lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband Scott and daughters, Abby and Ellie, where they serve alongside the people of Christ Presbyterian Church.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Patti Sauls\n\nOne tomato. I had grand plans for our backyard garden, but all I got to show for hours of watering and weeding was one, tiny, red tomato. I wish I could wax eloquent about the satisfaction of eating the fruit of my labors. (Fun fact: Tomatoes are botanically classified as fruit.) Instead, my lone tomato humbled me as I admitted that my efforts weren’t enough to produce abundant fruit. \n\nToday’s reading reveals garden rhythms as well. On the night before He was arrested, Jesus said to His disciples, “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener” (John 15:1). Jesus comforted His friends by reminding them that God vigilantly tends to all of His creation. \n\nJesus’s encouragement continued as He described branches, which grew from the vine and produced fruit. These branches, representing His followers, would be healthy and fruitful as long as they were connected to the vine. “Remain in me, and I in you. Just as a branch is unable to produce fruit by itself unless it remains on the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me” (John 15:4).\n\nThe apostle Paul further described this spiritual fruit, explaining that “the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control” (Galatians 5:22–23). These qualities shine collectively like the facets of a sparkling diamond. Together, they illuminate a Christian’s growing inner posture of dependence and obedience toward God, as well as her outer impact on the people and world around her. To this nourishing fruit I say, “Yes, please!”\n\nBut how do we produce such fruit? Do I summon my will power and attempt to weed out my sinful nature that so quickly yields hate, jealousy, selfishness, and worse? (Galatians 5:19–21). I may try, but as soon as I pull up one ugly weed, others sprout up in its place. This scramble ends with the same result as my backyard garden—little fruit and lots of awareness of my inability to produce it.\n\nAre we sentenced to fruitless despair? No, we are given a resource that Jesus announces and seals with a promise: “I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Counselor to be with you forever” (John 14:16). What deep relief! God doesn’t intend for us to muster up spiritual growth on our own. Instead, the Holy Spirit is poured out on us to work in us. \n\nAlthough we are dependent on the Spirit to produce fruit, we are not passive. As a sunflower turns its head to seek out the sun, so we can orient our lives toward God through prayer, Bible study, repentance, praise, and other habits. As Paul said, “If we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:25). We are free to put one foot in front of the other, confidently seeking faithful obedience while resting and remaining in the promise that God fuels our movement by His Spirit at work in and through us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jen Yokel\n\nOf all the aspects of the fruit of the Spirit, love feels like the most universal and, somehow, the most elusive. If you’ve ever tried to explain what it’s like, you know what I mean. Love can feel like analyzing every word of every conversation between meeting someone and confessing your feelings. It can feel like the comfortable silence of deep friendship. It can feel like filling your Instagram feed with pictures of a new baby, or late-night scrolling through photographic memories of a faraway friend. We write songs about it, cry while watching movies that try to portray it, maybe even try to deny it, declaring it a lie when our hearts are broken. \n\nBut Scripture tells us that the true definition of love is found in who God is. In fact, it’s one of the surest things we can know about God, a virtue greater than even faith and hope (1Corinthians 13:13). Scripture tells us “God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him” (1John 4:16). \n\nThe famous “love chapter” of 1 Corinthians 13 outlines many attributes of this love: patience, kindness, not insisting on its own way, rejoicing in truth, hoping and enduring everything. Enduring wars and disease and hatred. Outlasting empires and buildings and movements. In this litany of love’s attributes, I see the face of God. I hear God’s invitation to make ourselves at home in this love and let it transform us through the indwelling Holy Spirit.\n\nThis sort of love is nonsensical, if you think about it. It isn’t a vague, obligatory love for people who are like you, and it goes beyond the bonds of family, friends, or spouse. This love extends the circle wider and wider, transcending rational thought about who is worthy of love; it persists no matter what and in any circumstance, without condition.\n\nThe apostle Paul said, “The whole law is fulfilled in one statement: Love your neighbor as yourself” (Galatians 5:14). What could that look like today, as we imitate Christ to seek the welfare of our neighbors? When we make ourselves at home in God’s transformative love, we are changed. We are empowered to join God in repairing the world, to press on and show our neighbors what we value and to whom we belong.\n\n“You were called to be free, brothers and sisters; only don’t use this freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but serve one another through love” (Galatians 5:13). May it be so in us, the Holy Spirit growing love in our hearts for the flourishing of our families, our neighbors, and all of creation.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey T. Hurley\n\nBackstage, before any school music theater performance, our teacher would remind us: “Put on your Disney face!” The “Disney face” was a term meant to encourage happy, bright faces. We were to hold an extra twinkle in our eye, plaster on the largest smile, and over exaggerate each movement while we were on stage, to look as happy and as animated as a Disney character. But it was a façade. It was acting. Our smiles cracked around the edges, and the stage makeup smeared under the hot, heavy lights. The portrayed happiness was left onstage, a fleeting moment and not a reflection of the pain and problems of life off stage. Because in a high school musical, the story tends to end with a “happily ever after.” \n\nWhen I think of a Christian’s joy, I often think the world sees it as a fake, plastered-on type of joy. They believe we either ignore the real pain around us, choosing to remain ignorant of it, or we “fake it ‘til we make it.” After all, how could we possibly have genuine joy when everyone knows life is difficult and hard?\n\nBut “Disney face” happiness is not the true joy the Bible talks about. Biblical joy is not dependent on circumstances, nor is it something we have to force ourselves to feel. Our source of joy doesn’t come from ourselves; it is sourced by God who fills us “with all joy and peace” as we trust in Him and allow the Holy Spirit to help us through the trials and pain of life (Romans 15:13). \n\nTo see me in real life, it might be easy to assume I’m a joyful person, and many would find it difficult to grasp that I struggle with depression and anxiety. These symptoms pop up out of nowhere, and they can make me feel out of control, unable to pull myself out of the grief and fear that I experience. Yet, despite my personal dark seasons, there is an underlying presence of joy that continues. It is the Holy Spirit who holds the grief and the joy together and allows both to exist at the same time.\n\nEven though I may feel afflicted, I am not crushed. When I feel struck down by circumstances, I am not destroyed (2Corinthians 4:8–9). The power of Jesus to overcome sin, darkness, and pain gives me a source for joy. I can delight in a God who is not only sovereign over my life, but is also loving and slow to anger, compassionate and gracious (Exodus 34:6). And when things are tough, beyond my own ability to find a glimmer of joy, I am met in the midst of my pain. In His presence there is “abundant joy” (Psalm 16:11). \n\nSo, despite how others may perceive our joy, we have confidence that joy is rooted in something more than a smile on our face. It is a gift from the Holy Spirit, an everlasting hope. And as we walk with the Spirit, we are filled “with inexpressible and glorious joy” (1Peter 1:8). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nWhen I think about peace, I imagine three different things. First, I think of the wrap-around porch at my favorite bed and breakfast on Pawleys Island, South Carolina, where we like to vacation in the summer. It looks out over a marsh, where pelicans dive for fish and the sun paints the grasses yellow and then green. Second, I think of my friend Andi, a woman who imparts wisdom with every word she speaks, whose calm tone pervades every syllable. And finally, I think of the moment when my body sinks into a hot bath. The knowledge that I can sit undisturbed for 20 or 30 minutes is as soothing as the steam.\n\nBut our good God tells us that peace is not about a vacation. It’s not about trying to imitate a soft tone of voice, which while authentic to my friend Andi, would be disingenuous if I put it on for size. And it is not about finding more time for self-care, which brings only temporary relief. He knows that the world outside—and the world inside my own mind—is full of strife. But when Christ came, He promised to give His disciples PEACE, not as a means of escape, but as a means to exist and thrive without fear in the midst of the chaos of our world.\n\nAccording to the scriptures, peace is one aspect of the fruit of the Holy Spirit, something that God the Great Gardener will grow in our hearts and lives if we entrust ourselves to His care, no matter our circumstances. Peace will look different in different people’s lives. In the same way that hydrangeas bloom in different colors in different places, depending on the pH of the soil, peace will arrive in our hearts, blooming in its own way, in its own time. One thing is certain: if God promises to give it, then we will certainly receive it. \n\nIn John 14, Jesus says that peace is something He gives away, freely and without cost—not as the world might try to offer it (John 14:27). In Romans, the apostle Paul encourages believers to remember that “we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). And in his letter to the Philippians, he says “the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding” is able to guard our hearts and minds (Philippians 4:6–7). \n\nIn the end, our confidence comes not in our own ability to create peace, but in our relationship with the God of the universe who loves us and provides peace in abundance, simply as an act of His great love. Christ is a means of reconciling all people together in unity, no matter the earthly divisions that try to breed hostility between us (Ephesians 2:11–22). God’s peace is not theoretical. It is real. My circumstances might be in total disarray. Vacations and plans might be canceled. Factions might rise up against each other with weapons or words. In the midst of it all, our eternity is settled, our hearts can rest at ease, knowing that God is our peace.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nMy youngest daughter turns three next month. She is at the delightfully frustrating age where she wants to do far more than she is physically or emotionally able to do, and usually, that means I spend a lot of time waiting for her to “do it all by my OWN!” (Her adorable way of saying “myself.”) \n\nWe love to go on walks as a family in the evenings. My eldest flies down the sidewalk on her bike with training wheels, but my youngest isn’t very speedy. Nor does she try particularly hard to go fast on her scooter or her balance bike. More often that not, my husband and I trade off for the very arduous, slow task of pushing her, drenched with summer sweat, watching the other spouse laughing and jogging in the distance. No manner of coaxing, teaching, encouraging, or letting her go on hills will motivate her to do it herself. So a few weeks ago, I bought her a tricycle. I thought, Surely this will solve our nightly struggle! But dear reader, it did not. Now we just take turns pushing her princess-adorned tricycle up and down the hill.\n\nThere is no fast track for learning to ride a bike, but boy, has it ever tested my patience almost every night this past summer, along with nearly everything else about this almost-comically-catastrophic year. My patience ran out on day two of quarantine, and that was over eight months ago. Have we ever, collectively, felt so impatient, so restless, so tired of non-progress? I’m impatient for the past and the future at the same time. I reason, If we can’t go back to where we were, maybe we could at least hurry up and get to where we’re going! \n\nThis, my friends, is the same tension we feel spiritually. Our impatience for all things to be made new through the restoring, perfecting power of Jesus lingers every day. We long for it to be here soon—Maranatha! Come, Lord! The prophet describes this very longing, set in the hearts of all who believe (Isaiah 30:18–26). And yet, there is a difference between patience from the Spirit (waiting for God’s kingdom to reign forever!) and sinful impatience. \n\nSinful impatience says, “I know what’s right and exactly what I need, and I’m mad I’m not getting it right now.” Patience says, “I trust the Lord and His promises.” Scripture leads us to the same conclusion: a proud spirit is bound up in impatience (Ecclesiastes 7:8). Patience is grown from trust in the Lord and His timing, convinced He knows what we really need, in every realm and facet of our lives. \n\nI believe my daughter will learn to ride a bike. I believe Jesus will return. There are a lot of things I believe I need or want to be happy, but ultimately, my attitude is more often than not one of prideful impatience. It’s impatience born out of my desire to be in control. What the Holy Spirit provides through ongoing sanctification is true patience. I trust Him with my eternity; I need to better trust Him with each day. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Abby Flynn\n\nI grew up in the Midwest, but headed South after college in search of career opportunities and warmer weather. I eventually wound up in the Bible Belt, where I was swiftly initiated into the world of Southern charm. At first, I was shocked by how kind everyone was! But as the weeks and months in my new city went on, I realized not all of the “Bless your hearts,” were actual blessings. And most of the passing “We should get together sometime” farewells weren’t really future social invitations. It seemed that some Southern charm was actually just a cover-up for awkward situations. It was a way to seem like a nice person without ever actually having to do anything nice. Now granted, I still live in the South and have grown to love it. But I have to be watchful, even in my own life, of not mistaking being “nice” for genuine kindness.\n\nIn contrast, today’s reading reminds us of what real, Holy Spirit kindness looks like. And it’s about a whole lot more than just donating to charities and holding the door open for the person behind you. When we fully understand and begin to emulate real, Christ-like kindness, it will affect every aspect of our lives.\n\nTitus 3 shows us that God’s love and kindness are not just genuine—they have a purpose: to lead us back to Him! (Titus 3:4–7). So when kindness is evident in our treatment of others, we, in turn, are pointing them toward God. Because “when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit” (vv.4–5).\n\nAs followers of Jesus, we’re called to show graciousness and mercy to everyone, even our enemies. Yes, that even means the people we disagree with on Facebook, and the ones who have nothing to offer us in return (Luke 6:34–35). You see, kindness is at the heart of the gospel. We are all sinners and imperfect people who have been radically forgiven. There is nothing we could do to earn the love and mercy of the Lord, and yet He gives it to us freely. That’s kindness that we cannot begin to understand.\n\nSo as Christians, what does the Spirit producing kindness in us look like in everyday life? Maybe it’s the Lord making you a light in the world, offering hope to your coworkers or family. Or perhaps, it’s practicing graciousness in the middle of a difficult situation. Kindness might look like extending mercy to someone who has hurt you, whether they deserve it or not. Our kindness will play a huge part in our testimony, if only we will allow God to use it. But make no mistake, however kindness is exemplified in our lives, it is grown and cultivated by the Holy Spirit, a mark of His own kindness toward us.\n\nLord, open our eyes to see others as you see them: fellow image-bearers of our Creator. Make us instruments of your kindness and reflections of your mercy, even now.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Scarlet Hiltibidal\n\nOn my first date with my husband, we sat in his bright blue Honda hatchback in the church parking lot and he asked me a question. \n\n“What’s your favorite book of the Bible?”\n\nHis question was jarring since I’d been solely fixated on making sure the white eyelet babydoll-cut tunic top I’d worn for our date was hanging in the most flattering way possible. I hadn’t rehearsed a “favorite book of the Bible” speech, but I’d been a Christian-school-Baptist-church kid long enough to have an answer.\n\n“James,” I said.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because it’s really clear and it tells me what to do.”\n\nSomehow I found comfort in the clarity of James because I was still young enough to think I could be perfect, what with the book’s directives to consider suffering to be amazing, or the whole if you can’t control your tongue, your faith is false (James 1). I mean, I knew I’d messed up in the past, but with the start of a new day, I could start over at trying to be perfect, right? Or maybe even starting now—well, maybe not right-this-second now, but NOW, as in starting tomorrow. God would surely accept my goodness if it were fully and perfectly good starting tomorrow, right?\n\nThe words of James are holy and beautiful and true, but I was misunderstanding them because I was completely fixated on my goodness. I thought James was telling me to strive for joy in suffering and a perfectly controlled tongue and actions that perfectly lined up with every command in the Bible. I didn’t yet understand that having a relationship with Jesus would naturally produce the goodness James spoke about. I didn’t understand that the goodness I was to be pursuing was the goodness of God, fruit of the Holy Spirit, not the “goodness” of Scarlet.\n\nPsalm 31 declares, “How great is your goodness”—meaning God’s goodness (Psalm 31:19). If we’re aiming to bear fruit and striving to be thought of as good for the sake of our own identity, not only are we doing it wrong, but we will never get it right. God is good. We are broken. Pursuing goodness in our own strength also means pursuing heartbreak, failure, hopelessness, and even idolatry.\n\nBut if we pursue joy in the Lord, if we look at His goodness and remember the ways He is good to us—His power over death and ability to forgive us, and His promise to love us unfailingly—we can be people marked by His fruit. Not fruit that says, “Come see how good I look in my white eyelet shirt and with my awesome knowledge of the book of James!” But fruit that whispers that I am “radiant with joy because of the LORD’S goodness” (Jeremiah 31:12).\n\nBeauty, goodness, and joy pour out of us when, and only when, we are enraptured by and grateful for the goodness of the Lord. And in my limited experience, the more time I spend seeing and enjoying Him in the pages of the Bible, the more clearly I see that He is, just as our hearts hope, so very good.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Faithfulness",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Alena Pitts\n\nGod is faithful. \n\nAbout two years ago, I would have called God anything but faithful. I had just lost my mom and my world was turned completely upside down. God didn’t seem far. He actually felt nonexistent. “He is faithful. He is faithful. He is faithful,” I would forcefully utter to myself, barely believing it, whispering it, down on my knees. As a 14-year-old dealing with the gravity of not having a mom, the words “He is faithful” did not naturally spill off of my tongue. But I continued to utter those words, praying that they would one day become real to me.\n\nTrusting His faithfulness is one of the hardest things to believe about the Father. As humans who can’t see the full picture, we assume God has just stopped drawing it. When we can’t clearly see, hear, or feel Him, we assume He is not present. We believe He has left us. \n\nI, for one, am grateful that this isn’t just a 21st-century feeling. Throughout the Bible, we watch God’s people doubt His faithfulness time and time again. Sarah doubted that God would fulfill His promise of giving her a child (Genesis 18:10–15). The Israelites felt abandoned and lived in disbelief about God bringing them out of Egypt and into a future in the promised land (Exodus 16:1–12; 17:1–7). And throughout the psalms, David continues to ask God why He has left him (see Psalm 22). \n\nThank God that we see their pictures and stories fully drawn out. Sarah did receive her promised son (Genesis 21:1–7), the Israelites made it into the promised land (Joshua 21:43–45), and God rescued David again and again (see Psalm 30). It turns out He is still working, even when He seems silent. Here’s the best news: God doesn’t remove His promises from us when we doubt. He is compassionate, patient, and understanding (Exodus 34:6–7). What a humbling thought! \n\nLooking back now at the last two years of my life, I have experienced God’s faithfulness in an entirely new way. I didn’t see it then, but years later I clearly see His hand at work. Deuteronomy 7:9 says, “Know that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps His gracious covenant loyalty for a thousand generations with those who love him and keep his commands.”\n\nYes, God is faithful. His Word is true. And if we belong to Him, He makes us more like Him (1John 1:5–7). The Holy Spirit displays this faithfulness in and through us, which helps us to be faithful to God and to others (Luke 6:43–45).\n\nMy prayer for you is that our faithful, promise-keeping God would reveal Himself to you. That you would look back one month, five months, or a few years from now, and clearly see His hand on the canvas of your life. He is faithful, and by His Spirit, we grow in faithfulness.\n\nSixteen-year-old author, vocalist, and actress, Alena Pitts, recently made her professional acting debut in the 2015 film, War Room—the 6th-highest grossing Christian film in box-office history. She has since co-authored the three-book fictional series, Lena in the Spotlight, with her mother, Wynter Pitts, author and founder of For Girls Like You Ministries. Tragically, Alena’s mother passed from death to life on July 24th, 2018. While the loss has left them heartbroken, her family continues to tell Wynter’s story as an opportunity to share the hope they have found in Jesus Christ.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nIn an instant, the whole world seemed to fall away. We had just been told that our unborn child had serious and life-threatening medical issues. The doctor delivering the news was clinical…cold…indifferent. To her, this was just another baby who might not make it. To us, it was a category five hurricane of fear, stress, and pain. \n\nAs the doctor rattled off our options (none of them good), my heart started to race and my palms became sweaty. I was having trouble comprehending the information. I fought simultaneous urges to either bolt from the room and melt into the exam table. Then came the hand…\n\nThe ultrasound tech sitting beside me reached out his hand and held mine. He didn’t say a word. His gift to me was a soft touch. It was a simple, sweet gesture loaded with power. His gentleness put an oxygen mask on my heart. I could breathe again. I could think again. I could face my new reality. All because a stranger tenderly reached toward me. \n\nEncounters with true gentleness are rare. As broken people in a broken world, this is not our way, not our natural inclination. As I reflect on how I interact with others most often it’s clear: if life is a china shop, then I am a bull. In my flesh, I barrel my way through conversations, I crash through conflicts, I careen through daily life. Jesus reaches toward us with a different way, though—the way of gentleness. \n\nThe book of Isaiah records the prophet’s description of God’s power (Isaiah 40:10). But then Isaiah seems to make a hard right:\n\nHe tends his flock like a shepherd:He gathers the lambs in his armsand carries them close to his heart;he gently leads those that have young (Isaiah 40:11, NIV).\n\nGod doesn’t have mood swings. He isn’t one or the other—He is both. He is unmatched in both power and gentleness (Matthew 11:29). He commands heaven’s armies (Psalm 46:7) and tenderly leads His flock. He is the roaring lion of Judah and our precious Passover Lamb. All of this points to His power, which is strong enough to destroy sin and death and gentle enough to woo us toward Him with His grace. \n\nAs God’s children, the Spirit teaches us to live in this remarkable tension. We don’t have to clamor for attention, for influence, for power. Our lives can gently whisper about God’s goodness. And the world who is in the eye of the hurricane of sin and darkness will listen. God’s gentleness, extended through us, is so shocking it warrants attention. Jesus, in His mercy, has reached His gentle hand toward us. May the power of His Spirit help us reach out in gentleness toward others. \n\nLord, thank you for being our powerfully gentle Savior. Teach us to be more like you. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nBefore the kids woke up yesterday, I read 1 Corinthians 9 aloud to my husband over coffee. We don’t always read Scripture out loud to each other in the mornings. Often, mornings are all about the baby, and the puppy, and the breakfast preferences of the children. (Who hates blackberries? Have you eaten anything other than peanut butter this week?) But when I do read Scripture in the morning, I always end up reading it out loud—because it gets me so emphatically stirred up.\n\nWithin this passage, I took a startled pause at verse 27: “I discipline my body and bring it under strict control, so that after preaching to others, I myself will not be disqualified” (1Corinthians 9:27). I shouted to my husband, “Now, that’s not the gospel I know!” He looked at me in alarm because the children were absolutely still sleeping, and said, “I think Paul is talking about his qualifications as an effective minister.” \n\nThe gospel that I know is one of grace and faith, not a gospel of works. The “work” is already done by Christ’s sacrifice, death, and resurrection. There is nothing I can do to make God love me one iota more or one tick less. Hallelujah! Full stop. So how dare Paul talk about disqualification? And his reference to the physical training of the body, makes my sweet, soft, motherly self feel even more uncomfortable. I know that the gates of heaven don’t require me to qualify by running a mile in four minutes. But what does Paul mean? Because I’d like to skip over this bit and get back to the part where God is comforting me and telling me not to be afraid.\n\nBut Augustine of Hippo said, “If you believe what you like in the Gospel, and reject what you don’t like, it is not the Gospel you believe, but yourself.” Okay, right. Noted. Those are dark, deep, waters in which I do not wish to swim.  \n\nSo what is the role and value of self-control in the life of the believer? It is not the grounds of salvation, but it is the outpouring of a sanctified heart. “Now everyone who competes exercises self-control in everything. They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we have an imperishable crown” (1Corinthians 9:25). The self-control of athletes is laudable. So the Holy Spirit equips us to exercise self-control in our minds and hearts minute to minute as we encounter our days. This self-control is the practical outworking of genuine faith. We run as if to win, because we value the great salvation we already have in Christ—He has already won it for us.\n\nWe all know exactly where we can show more self-control: show more restraint, be less controlled by emotions, etc. But it’s probably personal and different for each of us. But I do not have the strength and self-control to pull myself together. If my resolve were strong enough to give up sugar and be a perfect parent, I would have already done it. But our self-control, our qualifications, and our strength come from walking in step with the Spirit. As we walk, our hearts will be changed and the courage and strength to exercise control over our weak and fragile minds and bodies will grow. Walk with the Spirit. Run to Christ and He will make you whole.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jessica Lamb\n\nGod is not only universally present above and beyond creation; He is also personally present, dwelling with His people.\n\nSometimes, I’m afraid to acknowledge the nearness of God. I’m afraid of what I’ll hear, or what uncomfortable truths I’ll have to face about who I am, because to encounter God’s presence means to be made more and more like Him (2Corinthians 3:18). So I ignore the reality of His persistent, relational presence, and instead turn to distraction: working more, endlessly scrolling through social media, blasting my favorite podcast, or binge-watching a television show—anything to numb my heart and mind.\n\nBut to live this way is to miss out on really knowing Him, to miss the opportunity to join the psalmist in proclaiming the gift of God’s presence: “As for me, God’s presence is my good. I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, so I can tell about all you do” (Psalm 73:28).\n\nOnce I started looking for the theme of God’s presence in Scripture, I began to find it on every page. Sure, I’d thought about God’s presence before. I know He is enthroned on high (Psalm 113:4–6). I know He fills the heavens and the earth and that there is nowhere I can go where He doesn’t see me (Psalm 139; Jeremiah 23:24).\n\nBut Scripture has so much more to say about God’s presence. In passage after passage, we’re told that God also desires to be relationally present with His people. Authors and biblical scholars J. Scott Duvall and J. Daniel Hays even suggest that this is the central theme of the entire Bible.\n\nGod heard every time the enslaved Israelites cried out against the injustice they suffered in Egypt (Exodus 3:9), and He showed up in a visible pillar of cloud and fire to lead them on their journey out of captivity (Exodus 13:20–22).\n\nGod is before all things and holds all things together (Colossians 1:17), and He intercedes for me in wordless groans when even I don’t know how or what to pray (Romans 8:26–27).\n\nGod can’t be contained in any house built by human hands (1Kings 8:27; Acts 17:24), yet He walked off the dusty roads of Judea and into the homes of sinners, tax collectors, drunkards, and fisherman to eat and drink with them (Matthew 24:49; Luke 10:38–42; 19:1–10).\n\nAs you’ll discover in this reading plan, we were created for this kind of relationship with God—to live in His presence, experience His goodness, and enjoy Him all the days of our lives. God has always drawn near to His people, and even now, He invites us to draw near to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jen Yokel\n\nOur holy God, through His grace and provision, welcomes imperfect people into His presence.\n\nOver the past few months, I’ve been fascinated by the life and writing of Julian of Norwich. As a 14th century English woman, Julian knew a thing or two about living in a chaotic world. From political turmoil to watching her community’s decimation by the Black Death, she no doubt sensed the fear of her world and heard the pains of her neighbors. I imagine as an anchorite, a woman living out her days secluded in a church yet still available to her community, her neighbors would have come to her. I picture her as a safe, motherly presence where they could confess their fears, vent their anger, and ask for prayer.\n\nYet for all this heaviness, here is a woman who could write these words: “All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well.”\n\nOver 600 years later, it is clear that all is still not well. This story stretches even farther back than the Middle Ages—the story of a people searching for the presence of God.\n\nLike Isaiah, we look upon God’s glory and despair at all we can never be (Isaiah 6:1–7). Like David, we ache to dwell with God and gaze on His beauty (Psalm 27:4). We talk about a Creator who is close to creation, maybe even catch a glimpse of Him in the laughter of loved ones or the roar of the ocean, yet we also read of the throne room in Revelation and wonder how we could survive such astonishing power (Revelation 4).\n\nWhat is this presence we all seek? What does it mean to find God when the world is in disarray and He feels unreachable?\n\nIn his letter to the Ephesians, Paul begins by reminding these faithful Christ-followers who they once were: without Christ, excluded and without hope (Ephesians 2:12). They were Gentiles, outsiders to Israel’s promises and citizenship, yet even that division, as Paul points out, is “done in the flesh by human hands” (v.11). God’s greater plan is a radical, cosmic hospitality, beginning and ending with a very real, human yet divine presence.\n\n“But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ” (Ephesians 2:13). In the mystery of grace, a Rabbi who loved, healed, laughed, wept, listened, and suffered also died and returned to life. He broke down the divisions between Jew and Gentile, slave and free, male and female, God and humanity. And in an even greater mystery, we become the dwelling place of God, each of us adding rooms to a living temple more glorious than the finest building in the world, a shelter from a world of plagues and turmoil and despair.\n\nGod’s presence, His dwelling, is no longer a place “out there” that we have to reach. It’s not an exclusive club or a far-off mountaintop. It is awe-inspiring, maybe even terrifying, and it is as close as skin and bone. It defies our human boundaries and looks like a parade of misfits who are grateful for a seat at the table. It is safety and warmth and family. All are welcome and there is always room for more, always a space to come in from the chaos and rest in the hope that all just might be well.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Patti Sauls\n\nWe can find courage and hope to endure all things because the powerful presence of our God goes with us.\n\nIt was over twenty years ago, but it feels like yesterday. Like clockwork, our first baby, Abby, would get fussy right before bedtime. Cue the footie pajamas, last bottle, diaper change, beloved blankie and a snuggle. I’d hold her close as she wriggled in my arms fighting sleep. Quietly, I would sing the familiar lullaby that my dad had sung over me: “Night, night, oh Abby. Sleepy tight, oh Abby. Close your eyes, oh Abby. Night, night, night, night… night.” Soon, her eyelids would get heavy, her breath would slow and deepen, and her little body would relax as she nestled into my chest.\n\nI wish I could wrap my head and heart around the fact that God holds me tight, that He loves me like this. Do we believe that God embraces us in our weariness? The prophet Isaiah insists that God is not remote or withdrawn. On the contrary, we need not fear because God is with us, He strengthens us, and He upholds us (Isaiah 41:10). Do we believe that God enjoys us and sings over us? Zephaniah 3:17 tells us, “The LORD your God is among you, a warrior who saves. He will rejoice over you with gladness. He will be quiet in his love. He will delight in you with singing.”\n\nGod is a warrior who saves. He fights for me and gives me refuge, strength, and help in times of trouble (Psalm 46:1). But it’s not only His powerful presence that gives me strength. His tender presence strengthens me too. Our God is a lullaby-singing warrior who loves His children.\n\nIsaiah reveals God’s deep tenderness by comparing Him to a shepherd: “He protects his flock like a shepherd; he gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them in the fold of his garment. He gently leads those that are nursing” (Isaiah 40:11). Our minds can’t fully grasp the reality of Almighty God stooping down to care for us in the messy, nitty-gritty of our daily lives. Yet we’re invited to see Him doting on us like a shepherd tending his needy sheep. This is how God has chosen to reveal Himself to us. He doesn’t merely tolerate us; He delights in us. He gathers us up in His arms, carries us close, and sings to us.\n\nYes, God is a fierce warrior fighting for His people and a singing warrior who delights in us and quiets us with His love. In this we find a nourishing strength that satisfies our souls. We can rest in His arms, close our eyes, and slow our breath as He sings over us. Instead of suffering our own pounding hearts, we can lean in and hear His steady heartbeat. It beats steadily with His love for us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey T. Hurley\n\nWhen we remember God’s presence goes with us and before us, we can find comfort in any circumstance.\n\nWhen we walk through the desert seasons of our lives, anxious and uncertain if we will ever make it to a safe place of rest, will we believe God’s presence goes with us? And will His presence be enough to rescue us from our fears?\n\nIt was 2018 and my husband was out of town when I had my first anxiety attack. I had no idea what was happening to me—why my heart was racing, why I was so faint, why I could not gain composure over my breathing. Feeling totally alone and out of control, I called 911 at 2am. I was hoping the paramedics would come and save me from what felt like a heart attack, only to be given a “sorry” glance as the paramedics packed up and confirmed it was anxiety.\n\nMonths went by and I couldn’t sleep, drive my car, or be away from my two-year-old without having severe anxiety over a possible future anxiety attack. I was emotionally, physically, and spiritually exhausted; I questioned why God allowed this to happen and wondered when He was going to come and deliver me from this ongoing fear and give me His peace instead.\n\nIn Exodus 33, God’s people were in the desert wondering when God was going to deliver them from their circumstances. With the people anxious for answers, Moses pleaded with God to reveal the next step and to promise to go with them as they journeyed to the promised land. Moses knew he was not going to be successful if God’s presence was not with them. He wanted assurance from God that He would be with them despite the future hardships they were sure to encounter.\n\nAnd God answered, “My presence will go with you and I will give you rest” (Exodus 33:14). God didn’t promise a specific day upon which they would finally rest in their future home. He didn’t promise that nothing unpleasant would happen on their journey. Instead, He promised His presence, which is more than enough to give God’s people comfort through any challenging unknowns—a promise we still have today.\n\nI may not know what will trigger a future anxiety attack, but God’s presence goes with me and before me. “I fear no danger, for [He is] with me” and His guiding rod and staff comfort me along the way (Psalm 23:4)—this is a prayer I can pray with confidence knowing God is near.\n\nAs you wrestle with setbacks, fears, difficult circumstances, unexpected bad news, and seemingly unanswered prayers, may you find comfort in God’s presence. His presence will strengthen you to continue to hope and wait on His rest and His peace. “May the Lord of peace himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with all of you” (2Thessalonians 3:16).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kara Gause\n\nAs we focus our hearts and minds on Him, we become more aware of our ever-present God.\n\nSomeone once asked me to picture my ideal eternity: with everyone I love present and accounted for, healthy and satisfied and fulfilled, with all my favorite treats and ways to while away the hours (if such a time constraint exists in heaven). If I could have everything I’ve ever wanted or imagined wanting, but God was not there, would I still be happy? Was my idea of heaven still “heaven” if God was not there?\n\nHuh.\n\nNow, I knew what the “right” answer was—boy, did I—but if I’m really honest, the right answer brought me no comfort or peace and, while I’m ashamed to admit it, no honest-to-goodness joy. The truth is that, when I imagined actually being in the presence of God, in the same room with Him, so to speak, well, I felt a lot more comfortable with one of us being on the other side of the door. You know, we’re aware the other is there, and we’re “good”: I recognized my need for Him, and He went to the cross for me so that we could actually be in the same room together.\n\nForever.\n\nNeedless to say, that one question took me on a journey of really beginning to look for God, to seek out His person, to really know Him. Because if He laid out His life for me, for the joy of having me with Him for eternity (Hebrews 12:2), and yet I somehow still felt the need for separation and physical distance from Him, then that was a problem. I had a sense that He went to the cross for more than just the effort of making us “good” with one another.\n\nI realized that to “seek His face” I would have to seek Him out intimately (1Chronicles 16:11). And when I searched for Him, when I sought Him out with all my heart and all my soul (Deuteronomy 4:29), He showed Himself to be anything but indifferent toward me. Through His Word and by His Spirit and the testimony of His Church (Colossians 3:14–16), He led me to really see the passion that led Him to the cross to die for me: so we could be in the presence of one another unencumbered by my sin, because “the LORD [our] God is a compassionate God” (Deuteronomy 4:31). The reality is that He is always with me because He wants to be. That truth leaves me utterly awestruck, yet somehow, I’m still prone to forget.\n\nSo, are you like me: have you continued to allow your shame to close your heart off from true relationship with Him? Have you believed the lie that the one who died a vicious and humiliating death to save you is somehow indifferent toward you? Take Him at His Word: seek Him, and He’ll remind you of what is true.\n\nIf you have been brought back into God’s presence through the blood of Jesus, then His presence and holiness aren’t meant to cause trembling from a place of fear, but of excitement and anticipation that one day, not so long from now, we won’t have to search for Him because we will get to see Him face to face (1Corinthians 13:12). Until that day, we don’t have to settle for just being “okay” with God—we get to have relationship with Him. We can seek Him out because He wants to be found.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Life with God in the Garden",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitie Stoddard\n\nGod created us to live and serve in His presence, but our sin made us unfit for life in the garden.\n\nRunning barefoot through soft, green grass was a quintessential part of my childhood summers. But when I moved to a desert climate as an adult, I learned that maintaining an inviting yard required a sprinkler system and a green thumb. Having neither, I struggled each summer to keep our landscape from turning dry and brown like the hills that surrounded us.\n\nMy battle with the vegetation each year is a consistent reminder that we are not living in the garden of Eden as God first designed it. Images of the Pacific Northwest, with their misty lakes and dense forests, may seem a little closer to that lush paradise on earth. But in our present state, when we dig beneath the surface, no place, person, or thing is truly perfect or whole anymore.\n\nI’m guessing most of us feel far from Eden. Whether it’s problems in our personal lives, the health of a family member, or devastation abroad, there is no shortage of brokenness here and now. But when we look back to the very beginning of creation, we learn that this suffering is not what God desired for His masterpiece.\n\nWe all know the story. When God made the earth, He “planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he placed the man he had formed” (Genesis 2:8). But we often miss the best part of the garden! It’s not the fertile ground or the naming of the animals, but the fact that God Himself walked among His people, in communion with them. God’s original intention was for men and women to live and serve in His presence.\n\nWhen Adam and Eve chose to sin by disobeying God, choosing their own way over His, the greatest consequence wasn’t pain in childbirth or a lackluster harvest, but separation from God’s presence. And that separation was banishment from Eden, death to the soul, and ultimately death to the body. When God first created the world there was no mention of death or destruction. It was only after humanity chose the way of sin that brokenness entered the scene.\n\nGod could have left it at that. Handing Adam, Eve, and every generation to follow, over to the downfall of our own decisions. But that is not who God is. God is merciful. God is love. And so, God sent His own perfect Son to be the man Adam could not. To live a righteous life, never choosing sin like we do. To be the spotless Lamb, sacrificed to atone for our damage. It was the greatest act of undeserved forgiveness, God giving Himself over to death to save the ones who’d betrayed Him.\n\nGod pays the price for our sin because He longs for complete connection with us once again, to walk in the garden with His creation. I cannot begin to fathom how deep His love is for us. But what I do know is that because of Jesus’s sacrifice we are welcomed back into the presence of God. Even in a land east of Eden, we can live and serve with God through His Holy Spirit. And for all who trust in Him, we will walk with our God in paradise again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nGod’s presence was with Moses and with Israel as they were brought out of slavery in Egypt.\n\nWhen Moses left Egypt, he had no map, no idea of which way to go, or what awaited him when he arrived. He had the presence of God to guide him, and he hedged his future (and that of the hundreds of thousands of Israelites who went with him) on the voice he heard in the wilderness, who appeared with a sweeping claim of authority and sovereignty:\n\n“This is what you are to say to the Israelites:I AM has sent me to you” (Exodus 3:14).\n\nThis story is a familiar one in Sunday school classes, Hollywood movies, and sermon illustrations. What I love about Scripture and these beloved stories is how many different lenses we can wear to examine them. While we could read this passage through Moses’s eyes, as I usually do, I believe it’s even more compelling to read it through the lens of God’s presence that was with Moses and His people.\n\nBeginning in Exodus 3, God reveals He has come to Moses because of the cries of His people: “Then the LORD said, “I have observed the misery of my people in Egypt, and have heard them crying out because of their oppressors. I know about their sufferings” (v.7).\n\nGod was there in Egypt, with His people. His omnipresence, His everywhere-ness, meant that He never left. And so when He called them out of Egypt to go behind Him into the wilderness, they followed. In Exodus 6, God identified Himself to Moses as the God who had been with his fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. His presence wasn’t new, but it was revealed in a new, personal way to Moses.\n\nGod directed the Israelites’ route, not “along the road toward the land of the Philistines, even though it was nearby” but “around toward the Red Sea” (Exodus 13:17–18). God wasn’t calling them out of oppression and then letting them stumble around, waiting for the stars to direct their steps; rather, He had a specific path for them to follow, one in which He would lead and they would have to learn to trust and follow Him.\n\nHis presence, provision, and promises are everywhere in this story. He was there, constantly providing for His people, whether defeating their enemies, sending manna and quail to nourish them, literally lighting their way, and more. He faithfully kept His promises to Moses.\n\nThis year, with its pandemic, politics, and personal tragedies, feels a little like the wilderness. I don’t know about you, but I would love a good map to show me how to navigate this season. Every road feels like a dead end these days, or maybe more of a roundabout that circles us around and around but never quite spits us out going in the right direction. None of the old paths work, and I’m not sure I want to go where these new paths are taking me.\n\nWhen God called Moses, He didn’t promise him an easy road. In fact, Moses himself never made it to the promised land. But God did promise Himself, His presence, and His perfect provision. He was always there. Today, I need to know that those promises, and God’s unfailing presence, are mine as well.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nLike Moses’s face made radiant by standing in God’s presence on Mt. Sinai, God’s people are transformed by life in His presence.\n\nWhen I read picture books about the garden of Eden to my children, I get asked a lot of questions about all the nakedness. “I can see Adam’s bottom!” my son shouts, knowing a cause for gleeful hilarity when he sees one. So, why were they naked? Genesis tells us there was no need for coverings because they were without shame (Genesis 2:25). In our original created state, our bottoms aren’t hilarious or embarrassing; they are what they are, which is to say, glorious hind ends. But the shame we experience as a result of our sin takes away our freedom. God’s holy and righteous presence can shine a light on our humiliation, but through the power of Christ, He has also taken away our shame and given us freedom from it. The presence of God’s perfect Son transforms us from shameful to glorious.\n\nMoses’s face was made radiant by standing in God’s presence on Mount Sinai. God prepared him, saying, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear when I speak with you and will always believe you” (Exodus 19:9). But the children of Israel did not want to see that nonsense; they were scared and unable to look Moses straight in the face (2 Corinthians 3:7; Exodus 34:30). They needed Moses to cover up the traces of glory lingering around his wrinkled eyes because it made them uncomfortable—it reminded them of their own shame and underscored the huge chasm between their own sin and a perfect, holy God (Exodus 34:33). But Moses had been transformed, and he didn’t even “realize that the skin of his face shone as a result of his speaking with the Lord” (v.29). This transformation is just a foreshadowing of the transformation we now experience through the life, death, and resurrection of Christ.\n\nFor if the ministry that brought condemnation had glory,the ministry that brings righteousness overflows with even more glory.In fact, what had been glorious is not glorious now by comparisonbecause of the glory that surpasses it. For if what was set aside was glorious,what endures will be even more glorious (2 Corinthians 3:8–11).\n\nThe old covenant of the law is only a shadow of our new and finished covenant in Jesus Christ. The glory of His presence is even more gloriously available to us who live in His covenant.\n\nHave you ever felt unable to discipline your children because of your own sin, worried that your own imperfection precludes you from upholding the rules in your own home? Have you ever felt ashamed to stand up for the truth of the gospel because you are ashamed of something you have done in the dark? The transforming power of Christ has set us free. We can leave our sin behind and walk forward with confidence in His presence. We are made free by His presence. Christ lifts the veil! Indeed, “where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom” (2 Corinthians 3:17).\n\nWe are a free people. By all means, wear pants, but walk forward leaving your sin and shame at the foot of Christ’s cross. The presence of the Lord equips us to do His good work without shame and fear. When you walk in His presence, the shame the world tries to pin on you can’t damage you. Let your face shine with His glory.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nGod provided a place for His people to draw near to Him.\n\nWe live in the shadowlands.\n\nConsider the tabernacle, that place of awe and wonder described often in the Old Testament. From cherubim stitched into towering curtains to pillars overlaid with gold, the size and beauty of the tabernacle would have taken our breath away. Yet, inside all of that artistry and engineering was something (or Someone) even more spectacular: “They are to make a sanctuary for me so that I may dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8).\n\nSit in that thought for a moment. Let your imagination try to wrap itself around the fact that the God who spoke the stars into being (Isaiah 40:26), the One who sits enthroned above the circle of the earth (v.22), and measures the waters of the earth in the hollow of His hand (v.12), chose to dwell in a tent built by human hands. What could speak to God’s love for us and to His desire to be in relationship with us more than this? But as spectacular as the tabernacle must have been and as breathtaking as it would have been to see the cloud of God’s presence descend (Exodus 40:34), it was only a shadow of a coming, greater reality.\n\nJesus did more than descend in a cloud. He wrapped Himself in human flesh and walked among the people He’d made. Through Jesus, man experienced fellowship with God undivided by poles and curtains. Yet even as we read about the Son of God walking and talking with man in the Gospels, we’re still just seeing shadows. God’s desire to dwell among the Israelites in the portable tabernacle and Christ’s willingness to take on flesh and live among mankind both point forward to the ultimate, full union of God and His people.\n\nJesus Christ is both the High Priest and sacrifice that we need: holy, innocent, undefiled. In order to be with us, He died “once and for all time when he offered himself” (Hebrews 7:27). Our High Priest’s work is finished, and now He sits “down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a minister of the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that was set up by the Lord and not man” (Hebrews 8:1–2).\n\nYes, the earthly tabernacle was eventually destroyed. And Christ’s human body became His glorified body before He ascended to the right hand of the Father, but those long shadows trace back and extend forward into a time when “night will be no more; people will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God will give them light, and they will reign forever and ever” (Revelation 22:5). Everything we experience here on earth is merely a shadow of the greater, redeemed reality that is to come in the new heavens and the new earth. We can endure life in the shadows because we know a day is coming when we will fully dwell with Him, and He with us, forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nGod’s presence filled the temple, and His people drew near and worshiped Him.\n\nMy church has been going through a study of the psalms of ascent (Psalms 120–134), fifteen psalms tucked toward the back of the book that chronicle the journey the Israelites made to Jerusalem to worship God in the temple. Each week, as we study another, I feel each step of the journey anew, inextricably linked in this year with the long separation from public worship earlier this year. The psalmist says, “I rejoiced with those who said to me, “Let’s go to the house of the Lord” (Psalm 122:1). His longing echoes my own to worship and be near God in His house. It’s a theme that permeates the psalms of ascent, and my heart today.\n\nBut why?\n\nWhy did the temple mean so much to the Israelites, that together they would sing as they walked up its steps? Why did it hurt with every beat of their collective heart when the temple was destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 BC? Why was building a second temple on the foundations of the first so important to the Jewish people when they returned to Jerusalem from exile? (Ezra 1).\n\nWhy? Because God’s presence came and dwelt there.\n\nIn 1 Kings 8, the elders of Israel bring the ark of the covenant to rest in the inner sanctuary of the newly finished temple. The ark of the covenant symbolized the Lord’s ongoing presence with the Israelites (Numbers 7:89). Since their days with Moses at Mount Sinai, the ark had been on the move. Now, it was brought into a permanent structure—the temple. Once it came to rest in the most holy place, “the glory of the LORD filled the temple” (1Kings 8:11).\n\nKing Solomon then offers a prayer of dedication that is one of the most beautiful speeches in all of Scripture. It’s a visceral prayer that must have echoed through the meticulously-planned walls of the temple. On and on Solomon goes, listing and describing the many times and ways and places the people would come to commune with their holy God in His temple (vv.31–42). The temple was different, and Solomon’s prayer punches through scenario after scenario of when the people could come into God’s presence via the representative priests who could enter the most holy place. The temple was a reminder that God was dwelling among His people. And yet, it was still separated by a curtain into the holy of holies, where only the high priest could enter once a year.\n\nThat is, until Jesus came as the physical presence of God on earth. And when He ascended into heaven, the Holy Spirit came to commune with God’s people, to guide them and be present with them. And one day, when Jesus comes again and believers live with Him in the new Jerusalem, God will be present with no curtains, no barriers, no fear, and no death.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nWhen God’s people turned away from Him, He removed His presence from the temple.\n\nThough the pages of Scripture contain many tragedies, the ones that stop my heart involve the loss of God’s presence. I think of Mary, who carried her Savior inside her womb, who studied the curve of His profile daily, who watched Him as He performed miracles. Then I try to imagine her at the foot of the cross. How could she find the strength to keep breathing when she pictured a future without Him near?\n\nI think of the disciples, who’d physically walked and talked with Jesus, and then had to wrap their minds around the fact that His body now lay lifeless in a tomb, shrouded in darkness. After they’d journeyed beside Jesus, how could they take a single step without Him?\n\nAnd I think of the Israelites, who experienced God’s presence as a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (Exodus 13:21), then stared with wide-eyed wonder as His glory filled the temple (1Kings 8:11).\n\nImagine the gut punch of hearing God’s righteous judgment on the sins of His people: “Has this house, which bears my name, become a den of robbers in your view? Yes, I have seen it too” (Jeremiah 7:11).\n\nI want to hold my breath as He declares: “I will banish you from my presence” (Jeremiah 7:15).\n\nMy heart aches when I read: “I will uproot Israel from the soil that I gave them, and this temple that I have sanctified for my name I will banish from my presence” (2Chronicles 7:20).\n\nAs I read these passages describing the loss of God’s presence, David’s prayer reflexively bubbles up: “Do not banish me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me” (Psalm 51:11).\n\nWhen panic about the loss of God’s presence makes our palms start to sweat, we need only to open our Bibles again. God doesn’t give and take His presence away willy nilly. True, because God is holy, our sin and God’s presence cannot co-exist. But let’s pause and remember the miracle of the cross: Because Christ’s death, we are welcomed into God’s presence wearing His righteousness—not our own failed attempts to achieve it.\n\nConsider God’s presence with renewed wonder today, friend. Thank Jesus again that He has made a way for you to be near Him. If you are a follower of Christ, you need not waste a single nanosecond worrying that you will be forced to live outside His presence again. Look no further than the gospel; because of Jesus, we can now experience the joy and eternal pleasures in our Creator God’s presence (Psalm 16:11).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "One Greater Than the Temple",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey T. Hurley\n\nThe presence of God came to earth and dwelt among people in Jesus Christ.\n\nAs Christians, we live in a post-temple world. It is difficult to fully comprehend a faith that required trips to the temple to sacrifice pure, spotless animals to atone for sin. But until Jesus came to earth, that is exactly what God’s people did regularly to appease God.\n\nThere were so many rules and regulations around temple worship depending on the type of sin committed, which animal you could afford to offer, and on what occasion. As time passed, the rules and regulations surrounding temple worship were manipulated as priests and “money changers” took advantage of those coming to offer sacrifices to God (see John 2:13–21). These misinterpretations and eyebrow-raising exchanges at the temple couldn’t possibly be what He’d originally intended—no, this system needed a lasting solution. A solution that could only come from God Himself.\n\nThankfully, God had a plan for His people that far exceeded a temple sacrifice: a person who was going to outlast a building, God Himself in the person of Jesus. “The Word [Jesus] became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:14). And as Jesus’s ministry grew, religious leaders became frustrated when He proclaimed that He could forgive sins.\n\nThe problem? No more visits to the temple. No more making profit from the people’s sacrifice. No more laws to twist and turn for their own power and control. Now, Jesus declared “something greater than the temple” had come: “mercy and not sacrifice” (Matthew 12:6,7).\n\nBut how?\n\nJesus Himself became the final sacrifice. As He took His last breath on the cross, the curtain that separated people from entering into God’s presence in the temple “was torn in two from top to bottom” (Mark 15:38). Instantly, through faith, we have access to God through Jesus who died for our sins and presents us “holy, faultless, and blameless before him” (Colossians 1:22).\n\nEven though we live in a post-temple world, we often still cut ourselves off from the access we have to God through Jesus. We still put rules around our faith and offer up sacrifices of perfect church attendance, clean and uncomplicated relationships, and spotless pasts. Instead of graciously receiving Jesus’s gift of mercy and forgiveness, we try to earn it on our own and punish ourselves when we make mistakes.\n\nWe cannot forget that the presence of God came to earth and dwelt among humanity, not to condemn it but to save it (John 3:17). Instead of looking for ways to “[condemn] the innocent” (Matthew 12:7), Jesus had compassion for people. And He desired not just our physical sacrifice, but our entire lives.\n\nFor those who trust in Jesus, there is no more curtain in the temple separating us from God’s saving grace. Let’s turn to Jesus, who is greater than the temple, confess and repent of our sin, and give thanks for His everlasting sacrifice that has removed all barriers between us and our Creator God.\n\nWriter and speaker Bailey T.

    "devo_title": "The Pouring Out of God’s Spirit",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Scarlet Hiltibidal\n\nOn the day of Pentecost, God’s presence was poured out on believers.\n\nDo you ever try to conjure up a feeling? Maybe you’re like me, prone to, ahem, an overabundance of feelings at all times. But, though the feelings you have are mighty, sometimes they aren’t the right ones. Maybe you want to feel empathetic, but you feel defensive. You want to feel loving, but you feel selfish. You long to hunger for the Word of God, but the 2020 quarantine was long, and you “accidentally” downloaded apps like, say, TikTok. Ahem.\n\nSometimes we want to feel the right things but pursue them the wrong way. We want to want the Spirit, right? Of course. Because, like 2 Corinthians 3:17 reminds us, “Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.” But how can we have the Spirit and feel the freedom He brings when life is so full of distractions and pains and questions that get us wanting other things we didn’t want to want in the first place? How can we be people who embody the Spirit who lives inside of us?\n\nIn Acts 2, Peter quotes what was once spoken through the prophet Joel:\n\nAnd it will be in the last days, says God,that I will pour out my Spirit on all people;then your sons and your daughters will prophesy,your young men will see visions,and your old men will dream dreams (Acts 2:17; Joel 2:28).\n\nDid you notice that it’s God who does the pouring out? It’s God who IS the Spirit. God is and God pours out. We, on the other hand, are to receive. But we’re not going to recognize what is available to us if we’re distracted, looking at Instagram or news updates more than we’re looking to God.\n\nIn Isaiah 32, we’re reminded of the glorious benefit of being filled with God’s Spirit: “The result of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever” (v.17). We have the Spirit of God. We can be filled with the Spirit of God. We can have and experience His peace. We can live with “quiet confidence forever.” The Spirit who came upon the apostles “like that of a violent rushing wind” is available to all of us who follow Christ (Acts 2:2). We don’t have to conjure it up. We don’t have to strive forever for the feeling of Christlikeness. The Holy Spirit is being poured out. Open the Word. Obey its instruction. Focus on filling more than feeling, and remember this: the work of Jesus Christ has already made you pure. Your sins are already forgiven. You are loved. You are full of God’s power, God’s peace, God’s presence, God’s life, God’s hope. Wow.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nThe people of God are the temple of God; His presence is active in the Church.\n\nI daydream about real estate. While others might be prone to scroll Instagram, “window-shop” online, or have wanderlust—I find myself pulling up Zillow, just for fun. I search for real estate in remote parts of the country as well as on my own street. I slide through listing photos, imagining life within four different walls, as if somewhere out there, there’s a better place for me, some home where I’ll finally have real peace. And of course, a view. But in my soul, I know I’ll never find what I’m looking for out there. The building where I live is far less important than what’s being built inside of me.\n\nGod dwells in holy places. From the ark of the covenant, too precious for human hands to touch, to Solomon’s temple in all of its splendor, God chooses spectacular places to display His glory. But when Jesus came to earth, He did so to change the zip code of God’s powerful Spirit. No longer would we have to go somewhere else to find God. Thanks to Jesus’s work on the cross, God can now build something beautiful, holy and sacred right within me.\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 3, Paul begs Christians to remember this truth: “Don’t you yourselves know you are God’s temple and the Spirit of God lives in you?” (v.16). Unfortunately, when I was a child, these verses in Scripture were all too often weaponized as a message of shame, intended to wag a finger in my face and remind me to remain sexually abstinent. At the very heart, this message from Paul isn’t about rules, but about a powerful, holy relationship. Being a temple of the Lord isn’t about what I do, but about what God is already doing in me.\n\nPAUSE FOR A MOMENT, and think about that. God could have chosen any house, and He chose to live with me, in me, and through me. In a way, it’s as if God looked through all of Zillow, through all time, found my listing—with my broken spirit and my jealous impulses and my numb, unfeeling heart—and said, “I’ll take that house, thank you very much.”\n\nThe good news is that God is a master renovator. He refuses to leave my heart the way He found it. Just like any good house, it only feels like home once you’ve put your personal touch on every wall. The Architect of the Universe knows what walls to tear down. He paints the walls of my soul with His peace, compassion, tenderness, and kindness. When I embrace the power that lives inside me, I can live in response to the Spirit’s heartbeat rather than my own impulses.\n\nConstruction is messy and we are all unfinished. But the good news—perhaps the best news—is that God promises to finish everything He starts (Philippians 1:6). And He’ll live here with me, in the mess, at work until that day comes.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nOne day, in the new heavens and new earth, God will dwell with His people as He did in the beginning.\n\nWe wash dishes by hand at our house. We are a big family, so it’s a bit of work, but after years of loading and unloading dishwashers only to find dirty dishes inside, it’s worth it for us. I have three sink basins, in the first I rinse, the second is filled with hot soapy water for washing, and the third has a special hot faucet for rinsing. Above the sink, mounted to the wall, are four big drying racks. Everything smells like lemon and optimism. Once my dishes are shiny and dripping on the metal racks, a child has usually brought in one last bowl and spoon. After that, someone finds a stray coffee cup, and before my dishes have dried, the first sink is full again with ladles, milk glasses, and unnecessary straws.\n\nOur work is never done on this side of heaven. The dishes will never be done. Life is better when I don’t expect a full stop from things that do not stop. The garden does not stay weeded. The beds need to be made every morning. It’s the same regardless of your station in life, the color of your skin, or the size of your bank account. Wealth does not bring happiness. Look at King Solomon in Ecclesiastes, who had limitless wealth, massive power, hundreds of women, and access to any imaginable pleasure the world had to offer. And yet his conclusion, after wearing out every fleshly gratification he could think of, was that it’s all vanity, all just wind and nothing. “All things are wearisome, more than anyone can say” (Ecclesiastes 1:8). And if that guy, with all his resources, found that our hope is not found under the sun, do you think that you’re going to discover something different?\n\nNow, don’t misunderstand me, the fresh glory of a sunrise over mountains and the squishy skin of a new baby and the arms of my husband all hold a true and inexpressible joy for me. The beauty of the world and its people is for our joy. But none of it will satisfy our deepest longings. None of it will make us complete. In the world, no matter how much we love the smell of lemon, there will always be dishes to wash, and our favorite ones will continue to break, and our dogs will die, and our houses will burn, and we will bury everyone we love until they bury us.\n\nBut there is a land where there is no death, no sickness, no depravity, and no shame. And, boy, I hope we will see our pets, because there’s a good girl I sure wish I could see again. We will lay down our tools and run home, into the arms of our Father. He has promised us this: “Look, God’s dwelling is with humanity, and he will live with them. They will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them and will be their God” (Revelation 21:3).\n\nOne day, in the new heaven and new earth, God will dwell with His people as He did in the beginning. We were created for life in our holy God’s presence. Our sin keeps us from coming close to Him. But He comes to us and brings us home. There we find our settled rest, not like guests or strangers, but like a child who is truly home (Psalm 23).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jen Yokel\n\nFrom the call of Abram to our inclusion as spiritual descendants, God’s promises to His people are marked by His presence.\n\nJacob had blown it. Maybe he felt shock and relief that he’d actually pulled it off, convincing Esau to surrender his birthright. Maybe he felt the knot of remorse in his gut as he laid down under the stars with a stone for a pillow. Perhaps he tossed and turned a little, regretting and second-guessing, as he drifted off to sleep as the new bearer of the family promise, his dreams filled with light and color.\n\nAngels! Climbing a ladder, up and down. Hearing a voice his father and his grandfather spoke of so fondly, declaring, “I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac” (Genesis 28:13). And that same voice was repeating a litany of promises: good land, countless descendants who would bless the whole world (Genesis 28:10–22).\n\nThis promise wasn’t new. His father Isaac heard it when God told him to stay in a strange land and trust Him through a famine (Genesis 26:1–6). Years before, this same promise led Abraham away from everything he’d known in Haran (12:1–7), and he would continue to hear it for the rest of his life (17:1–8).\n\nI can’t help but wonder about the apparent silences in between, the years of living off strange land and living with family who sometimes stirred up more trouble than blessing. In the midst of unfulfilled plans, God’s voice remained constant, repeating the promise. God still appeared, again and again, to unlikely, fallible people.\n\n“Look, I am with you,” God assures Jacob as the ladder evaporates into the space between dreaming and sunrise. “I am with you, and will watch over you wherever you go” (Genesis 28:15).\n\nMost of us aren’t holding out for a plot of land and kings in our family tree, but I wonder if the land was even the point. Over and over, as God repeated His promises, these men continued to live colorful lives, listening to God yet failing, repenting, and then breaking relationships, only to come home limping in shame—quite literally, in Jacob’s case.\n\nIsn’t that all of us, though, in the great spiritual family of Abraham? We may not trace our blessings by bloodline, but we find them in Jesus, the one who lived a blameless life that only Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob could dream of. Jesus is the one who came to be God’s presence among us, showing us the way, sealing the promise, and blessing the whole world through His life, death, and resurrection.\n\nCenturies after Abraham gazed at the stars and left his homeland behind, a former fisherman and friend of Jesus would repeat the promise one more time: “You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your ancestors, saying to Abraham, ‘And all the families of the earth will be blessed through your offspring’” (Acts 3:25).\n\nThe ultimate blessing is so much more than land, power, influence, or wealth. The blessing is found in Jesus, “God with us” (Matthew 1:22–23), living and dying and defeating death to reunite His family and live with us forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitie Stoddard\n\nGod calls His people to take part in establishing His kingdom on earth, and His presence secures our victory.\n\nI played on a smattering of different sports teams growing up. Soccer, volleyball, basketball—I tried them all at some point or another. And while I loved athletics, I was never the “star player” of a team. You know that kid who seems like they were born to swim laps or shoot a three-pointer? I wasn’t that kid, but I got to play on teams with that kid. And having an exceptionally talented athlete on your team is a blessing, because their strength becomes your team’s strength.\n\nWhen I think of God’s power, I think of Him like that star player who carried the rest of our team on to victory. Sure, everyone got to participate during the game, but make no mistake, there would be no “win” if God didn’t show up to make the plays and set the strategy. Honestly, He could win every single game by Himself, but He graciously chooses to involve and work through other players.\n\nThe thing is though, in our daily lives God is often an unseen force leading our team. And so we can make the mistake of thinking we need to be the star player or maybe even call some of the shots. Perhaps we feel God prompting us to help build His kingdom in a specific way, but then we think all the pressure rests on our shoulders. Let me tell you from experience, that is a recipe for disaster. Either we will become prideful and think we really are the star of the show and take all the credit that God deserves, or we will become fearful, knowing we cannot measure up, causing us to spiral into discouragement.\n\nThe book of Joshua reminds us that it is through God’s power, not our own, that His kingdom is built. God directed Joshua to lead the Israelites into the promised land. It was natural for them to be afraid as they stepped onto unknown soil with enemies around every corner, but God continually reassured His people that He would never leave them. He would show up for the game. They only needed to trust and obey. God would carry them to victory, and they would get to participate in the celebration.\n\nJust as God encouraged the Israelites to be “strong and courageous,” He encourages us to do the same. In every good work the Lord has called us to, we must not forget that “the LORD [our] God is with [us] wherever [we] go” (Joshua 1:9). It does not all rest on our shoulders. In fact, God doesn’t need us to accomplish His purposes. We should neither be arrogant nor insecure. Instead, we can be grateful we get to play on the winning team, taking part in the thrill of a game well won, and celebrating the victory that God has already secured. While we work passionately, we no longer sweat the outcome because we know that in the end, God always wins.\n\nWhen Christ went down to the grave and rose up victorious, not even death could defeat Him. Just as we join with Christ in His death, we will one day join with Him in resurrection (Romans 6:5). As Paul says, nothing can separate us from the love of God (Romans 8:39), and that is the greatest prize of all.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Walking in God’s Presence",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nWe are called to follow Jesus and walk with Him daily, learning about life in His kingdom.\n\nEarlier this year, I started taking long walks at a local park. Because it was springtime, the surrounding fields were vibrant and the aroma of honeysuckle lingered in the air. These walks became my evening pilgrimage. No matter how restless my heart and body became during the day, this steady, put-one-foot-in-front-of-the-other rhythm of movement restored me to balance by the end of each mile. Disharmony and agitation were exchanged for peace and surrender.\n\nDuring a lonely three months, Jesus kept me company on these walks. I’ve always felt closest to God in nature, and there’s something about the art of walking that draws me in even closer. Maybe it’s the sights along the way or the forward movement itself that feels like taking action. Whatever the reasons, I feel invited into something—into new ways of seeing and being that are unlike what I experience sitting under a cozy blanket or at a cherry-red stoplight.\n\nWalking with God isn’t limited to the act of walking, though. After all, what about those who don’t have that physical capacity? Walking with God is about accepting the invitation to keep company with Him. As we intentionally keep company with our Savior, we become more aware of His presence and learn to move to the rhythms of His love.\n\nWhen Jesus walked along the Sea of Galilee, He called out for Peter and Andrew to follow, and the disciples “immediately… left their nets and followed him” (Matthew 4:20). This was an invitation into companionship with Jesus. It was an invitation into new ways of seeing and being. It required action—and not just from their feet but also from their hearts.\n\nJesus also called out to John and his brother James, the son of Zebedee (Matthew 4:21). He then drew those from the regions of Galilee, Jerusalem, the Decapolis, Judea, and the Jordan (v.25). You might call Him a collector of people because of how His presence compelled others to follow. Of course, this wasn’t a lust for attention; it was because there was something about Jesus’s company that transformed people.\n\nIt’s easy to grow distant and inattentive to Jesus’s presence. But because the Holy Spirit inhabits us, we know that God never leaves us. We can’t escape Him, but we can walk toward things that draw us away. This is why Jesus said, “Remain in me, and I in you” (John 15:4). Walking with awareness of God brings us intimacy and abundant life that just isn’t possible apart from a relationship with Him.\n\nThere will always be activities and anxieties that feel urgent. I hope we learn the slow, steady practice of walking with our God every hour of the day because it’s here that we grow in our relationship with Him and learn the rhythms of His love. Whatever our hands find to do, I hope we carry a willingness to drop our nets when He calls and keep company with Jesus.\n\n",

Since he doesn’t quite understand the concept of “ripeness,” my two-year-old son often walks to the plot and picks off a green or yellow raspberry, only to drop it with disappointment into the soil. “You can’t pick them when they’re green,” I tell him. “They need to stay on the vine.”\n\nGod’s presence is a mysterious concept. At times, I’ve felt His closeness like a breath on my cheek. Other times, I’ve had to trust that His nearness is truth—regardless of my emotions or sensations. If I trust Jesus, then I must take Him at His Word, and He tells me over and over again through Scripture that He will not leave me behind, He will always be present, and even when He is not physically present, that the Holy Spirit will stand in the gap. God’s presence in my life is like the nutrients that move from soil through the vine into an unripe raspberry. Cut off from the source, nothing blooms. Cut off from His presence, I will be nothing but wasted potential.\n\nOften, I can be tricked into believing that in order for me to experience God’s presence, I need a plush upholstered chair, a window that emits plentiful natural light, a cup of just-brewed coffee, a journal, a good pen. Silence. But God is present with me, even when I am not aware of Him. And if God is always with me, then He is with me in the chaos of the day, just as much as He is in the precious moments of morning quiet. In the Great Commission, Jesus is sending His closest friends into oppositional territory, to places where they will be persecuted, hunted, and ultimately, killed. And despite that terrifying reality, Jesus promises them: “I am with you always” (Matthew 28:20).\n\nJesus is with you too—today, yesterday, and forever. No matter what you’re facing. No matter the sorrow past or present, He is here, grieving with us, celebrating with us, growing and filling us with His Spirit, and helping us take steps forward with hope.\n\nThere is no check-list of solitude or calm required for God’s presence to attend to your weary soul. He is here, now. He is with you, always. His presence flows into your heart, whether you feel it or not, whether you see it or not. All you must do is stay on the vine.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Patti Sauls\n\nIn Christ, our place in God’s presence is secure. We cannot be separated from His love.\n\n“Hey, Patti! So glad you’re here.”\n\nI’ll never forget how Sue, my high school ministry leader, greeted me the first time we met. Even though I had heard a lot about her from my friends, I still felt shy as we walked up her driveway and swung open the back door without even knocking. My friends made themselves right at home, searching Sue’s refrigerator for soda that she always kept well stocked, and plopping down on her kitchen stools. In walked Sue, laughing at our unannounced arrival and welcoming us all. Before I could awkwardly introduce myself, she greeted me by name.\n\nHearing Sue call me by name spoke to my longing to be known and stirred my hope for belonging. It meant the world to my insecure, 15-year-old self, and it means the world to me now. Little did I know that we would spend hours together, that she would share her life stories with me, and that she would explain the meaning of Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection to me. Little did I know that Sue and I would become friends for life.\n\nHearing Jesus describe Himself as the “good shepherd” also stirs my hope for belonging. His shepherd metaphor stops me in my hustling tracks and tugs at my solitary heart. “I am the good shepherd,” Jesus says. “The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep” (John 10:11). This shepherd doesn’t merely offer the bare minimum; He offers His life. He is ready and willing to die in order to protect His sheep from attack. Jesus also says that the good shepherd “calls his own sheep by name and leads them out” (v.3). He doesn’t casually regard the flock as a random collection of animals. He leads them out to pasture where He satisfies their hunger and thirst. Not only that, but He knows each one intimately, and He calls them by name.\n\nDo we hear Jesus’s voice? Do we hear His promises? Jesus promises the ultimate belonging: to be fully known and fully loved by Him forever. He says to every one of His followers, “I see you. I know you intimately. I know your deepest hunger and thirst. I love you. I will provide for you and protect you, even if it means laying down my life.” And, it did—it cost Him everything—Jesus died to divinely and decisively deal with the sin that separates us from God. He died once and for all so that we can be united with Him forever.\n\nEven though it is hard for us to imagine life without end, this is His promise: “I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand” (John 10:28). Jesus protects His flock and seals the deal for those who hear Him and follow. “Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord” (Romans 14:8). He calls each by name to be with Him and to become friends for life—both now and for eternity.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 1:1-17, 2 Samuel 7:12-16, 2 Corinthians 5:17\n\nIf you could have access to only one book for the rest of your life, which would you choose? \n\nJudging from their devoted habits and bold commentary, it seems a great many theological giants in Church history would have made Romans their go-to text for a lifetime. Early church father John Chrysostom had the book read aloud to him once a week. Poet and preacher Samuel Taylor Coleridge called it “the profoundest piece of writing in existence.” The famous sixteenth-century Bible translator William Tyndale wrote of Romans, “It is the principal and most excellent part of the New Testament… No man can read it too oft.” Martin Luther, St. Augustine, and John Wesley all came to assured faith through the impact of Romans.\n\nWhat is it about this book that has captivated the attention of believers across the ages? What makes Romans so unique? \n\nAll Scripture is God-breathed and equally valuable—God’s special revelation given to us that we might know Him. But Romans is distinct in that it provides the most comprehensive expression of the gospel found in the Bible. This book reaches back deep into the Old Testament to walk us through the origin and problem of sin, the reality of guilt, and the impossibility of saving ourselves. And it presents, systematically yet succinctly, the ultimate rescue we’re given in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn short, Romans contains the essential gospel.\n\nFrom the opening statements of his letter, Paul makes clear his purpose for writing: to present and promote the gospel of Jesus Christ. He introduces himself as Christ’s servant, “set apart for the gospel of God” (Romans 1:1). He addresses the letter to “all who are in Rome, loved by God,” expressing his commitment to telling them “the good news about [God’s] Son” (vv.7-9). And he conveys how desperately he has desired to visit the city personally: “I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome” (v.15).\n\nPaul then turns from his brief introduction to make a stunningly clear pronouncement on where he stands when it comes to the message of Christ:\n\nFor I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.\n\n– Romans 1:16\n\nPaul was confident in his calling to preach the gospel because he was certain of the saving power of his God. I am a servant of Christ… I am an apostle… I am set apart for the gospel… I am eager to preach the good news… I am not ashamed. \n\nIt is with this unshakeable confidence that Paul, the self-proclaimed “worst of sinners” (1 Timothy 1:15), wrote to the believers at Rome—to explain to Jewish and Gentile converts alike what it means to believe in and be redeemed by Jesus Christ. For this is no metaphorical salvation; it is the real-life rescue of broken and complicated people by the all-powerful hand of a merciful God.\n\nLean in close as Paul presents his longest letter in Scripture, a sermon on what it means to be a Christ follower in this life. Listen as he tells of God’s holiness, justice, and compassion. Read this book as though it is telling a single story—the story of how God rescues us through the sacrifice of Christ.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Righteousness and Wrath of God",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 1:18-32, Proverbs 1:7, 2 Timothy 3:1-9\n\nIn all of Paul’s letters, there are few bleaker passages than the one we encounter in Romans 1:18-32. Here Paul paints a picture of total depravity, gleeful rebellion, and blind rejection of God—all of which incur the deserved wrath of God. It’s dark and it’s grim, but there is one thing you especially need to know about it:\n\nIt’s your story.\n\nIf you’re like me, that might sound strange. Like many lifelong Christians, I was raised in the church, a rule-following “good girl” who never colored outside the lines. My life looks nothing like Paul’s portrait of self-destruction. And yet, his language is intentionally vague. He never specifies who this passage is about. Scholars have speculated—perhaps it’s about Adam and Eve, or perhaps he is describing non-Christians. But most scholars, like Dr. Douglas Moo, a professor at Wheaton College, interpret his words more broadly: “[Paul] has in view human beings generally, prone to turn away from God because of the original fall into sin.” \n\nIn other words, this passage is about us. \n\nPaul speaks of the “godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth”—the people who struggle with “envy, murder, quarrels, deceit, and malice” (vv.18, 29). And those people he’s describing? Well, they’re us—all of us. Paul isn’t singling out a particular group of people; he’s diagnosing the human condition. \n\nLeft to our own devices, sin distorts our souls like water-warped wood. For every human ever born, that is our story. At least, it would have been our story had God not intervened.\n\nWhat we see in Romans 1:18-32 is a vision of our fate, had God not planned our rescue. Without God’s grace we were all “by nature deserving of wrath” (Ephesians 2:3). To understand exactly what these harsh words mean, we must be careful not to confuse God’s “wrath” with human forms of anger. Theologian John Stott describes human anger as “irrational and uncontrollable emotion, containing much vanity, animosity, malice, and the desire for revenge.” God’s wrath, on the other hand, “is absolutely free of all such poisonous ingredients.” \n\nBy comparison, God’s wrath is His “holy hostility to evil.” This hostility is not arbitrary. God does not pick rules out of a hat, and smite those who fail to conform. No, God directs His hostility squarely at the destructive effects of sin. Sin steals, kills, and destroys everything it touches, including the crown jewel of His creation: humankind. It degrades and dismantles us, and God’s response to this cosmic terrorism is total opposition. God opposes sin because He is good and righteous and just. \n\nHe also opposes it because of His love. Like a father’s white-knuckle rage at his son’s addiction, or a mother’s howling grief at her daughter’s eating disorder, God’s wrath is an expression of His love. It is hostility towards that which devours His children whole.\n\nThis side of eternity, we may never understand the mysterious balance between God’s active condemnation and the natural consequences of human sin. But together, these two elements constitute God’s righteous wrath against all human sin. That is our story—every one of us. Apart from the grace of God, we would only choose death. \n\nWhenever we read these words, we must ask the Spirit to reveal ourselves within them, because we cannot have the good news without the bad news. We cannot call it “salvation” if we are not being saved from something—namely, ourselves. Self-ruin is the only place our sin will ever take us. But, thanks to Jesus, it doesn’t have to.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

Confusion filled her dark brown eyes. “I don’t understand,” she said.\n\nI explained further. “The Chinese and Japanese character used to translate ‘sin’ is the word zui, which means ‘crime.’”\n\nShe nodded and motioned for me to continue.\n\n“I think that translation can be somewhat limiting. I imagine you haven’t really spent time in jail or committed a crime like robbing a bank. I imagine you consider yourself a pretty good person.”\n\nShe nodded again. \n\n“I used to think of myself as a pretty good person, too” I said. “But then someone asked, if a movie were made of my life, if there were certain scenes I’d want deleted. I knew exactly which scenes I didn’t want anyone to see. And these scenes were not just of the times I did things I knew I shouldn’t, but also when I didn’t do things I knew I should. Our sin problem shows itself in both ways—in the things we do and the things we don’t do. We all sin. No one lives a life free of scenes they wouldn’t want others to see.”\n\nPaul goes to great lengths in the first three chapters of Romans to help us understand the totality and consequences of our sin. He lists the manifestations of sin at the end of chapter one, then goes on to explain how his readers not only judge others, but also practice the very things for which they pass judgment. \n\nAnd it’s true: most of us consider ourselves “good” people, qualified to judge others for their many shortcomings—that is, until we place our own sin-plagued lives next to Christ’s righteousness. Jesus is the only one who lived a perfect, God-honoring, shame-free life. \n\nBoth Jews and Gentiles—and both you and I—fall short under God’s holy judgment. We are all guilty, often of the very same things for which we condemn others. But there is good news: \n\nFor God loved the world in this way. He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.\n\n– John 3:16\n\nWe are born spiritually dead, our sin separating us from a life with God. But God, in the person of Jesus Christ, has made a way for us to know Him, both in this earthly life and for all eternity (John 17:3). \n\nJust as God Himself provides the way for us to be reconciled to Him, He also does the work of revealing to us our sin—of showing us how our “goodness” falls short of His righteousness. The Holy Spirit does the convicting (John 16:8), which frees us to love and to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15).\n\nIn Romans, Paul writes systematically to knock away our sense of ever being righteous in and of ourselves. God’s invitation is not to mere ethics or manufactured goodness, but to the utter, complete transformation that takes place when we are made new in Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nMay God melt away our pride that keeps us from total dependence on Him. By His grace, may we love others, even as they fall short like we also do. And may we recognize and receive God’s kindness that leads us to repentance.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 2:17-29, Deuteronomy 7:25-26, Psalm 51:1-12\n\nIn one of my seminary classes, we were to read Athanasius’ On the Incarnation, as well as— according to the syllabus—the book’s preface written by C.S. Lewis. Paying close attention to the syllabus (thought not that close), I read both the preface and the introduction.\n\nA few weeks later, during his lecture, the professor pointed out that we technically didn’t have to read the book’s introduction, but he said if we’d been smart, we would have. He explained this had been his intention—even if the syllabus hadn’t spelled it out explicitly.\n\nWas he assuming we were mind readers? Not really. He just had expectations. \n\nAt some point, we all give instructions—to colleagues, to children, to friends, to husbands—that may not be perfect or exact, but we hope the recipient will pick up on our intent, on the spirit of what we’re asking them to do. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t. \n\nPaul is giving a similar instruction here to the Jewish Christians in Rome. He is echoing Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, asking Jesus’ followers to read deeper into the Law. Paul tells them it’s not about following the letter of the law. It’s about following the heart of the One who wrote it. \n\nPaul’s laundry list of law-breaking activities in verses 21-23, reads similarly to what Jesus said in Matthew 5:\n\nYou have heard that it was said to those of old, “You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.” But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment.\n\n– Matthew 5:21-22\n\nJesus preached these words to some who knew the Law backwards and forwards, but He was holding up a magnifying glass to their hearts. They weren’t out murdering people—they were law-following Jews, after all—but what was going on in their hearts? Were they angry with their brother? Jesus said then they, too, are deserving of punishment. The spirit of the Law was broken, even if the exact rule was not. \n\nPaul does the same for his readers. He questions their obedience to the Law, but then he reminds them it’s the posture of their hearts that matters most. These proud Jewish Christians came from a long heritage of trying to earn righteousness by following the Law. They too easily forgot that Jesus came to fulfill the Law for them, to make them righteous by simply believing in Him. \n\nIt’s not hard to see myself in the Jewish Christians of Rome, slipping back into trying to follow the rules rather than the One who wrote them. It’s easy to think my righteousness comes from  acting the right way, rather than from “the Way” Himself (John 14:6). But as the psalmist tells us, “would God not discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart” (Psalm 44:21).\n\nIf I’m honest, what’s going on inside my heart is usually much uglier than how I act on the outside. Thankfully, Jesus came to wash me clean from the inside out. This is the beauty of the cross and the gift of the Holy Spirit: to compel me to seek God’s heart first, and obey His law by the help of His Spirit.\n\n \n\nMelanie Rainer is the director of content for JellyTelly, where she writes and edits family spiritual formation resources.

He lived, died, and rose again for sinners. He forgives sinners. And sinners who place their faith in Him are welcomed into His family.\n\nThat’s really good news for sinners, right? And Scripture leaves no doubt. You, me, and every person on earth… we’re all sinners. That’s the bottom line Paul lays out in Romans 3:23.\n\nWe’re all broken, needy, and messed-up in a way that simply being “good” can never fix.  \n\nSince the Garden of Eden, our identity as humans has been marked by our tendency to rebel against God. That’s why we can never behave our way into a right relationship with Him. The most well-behaved, law-abiding, church-attending, choir-singing, modest-dressing, moralistic person alive, apart from Jesus Christ, is still dead in her trespasses and sins (Eph 2:1).\n\nThe heartbeat of the gospel is not, “Clean up your act, obey the rules, and God will forgive you.” That’s moralism, not Christianity. Any one of us who has ever tried to be a perfect person, even for a day, knows that approach simply doesn’t work. That false gospel stands in direct contradiction to the true one: Christ died for sinners. Because He loves us, remember?\n\nDo we encourage each other—and ourselves—to obedience? Absolutely! But let’s also remember that righteousness does not come through our obedience. Right standing with God comes only through faith in Jesus—His works and not our own. As Paul says in verse 24, “They are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”\n\nThrough Jesus, grace flows freely to sinners. Through Jesus, those guilty and condemned are declared righteous—justified by His sacrifice, by grace through faith. And through Jesus, polluted sinners exchange filthy rags for robes of righteousness.\n\n“I greatly rejoice in the Lord,\n\nI exult in my God;\n\nfor has clothed me with the garments of salvation\n\nand wrapped me in a robe of righteousness… ” (Isaiah 61:10).\n\nCarrie Gaul is a biblical correspondent for Revive Our Hearts. She and her husband Dennis have two married children and are enjoying grandchildren. Carrie has a deep love for God’s Word and a passion to see women grow in ever-increasing intimacy with Jesus through the study and application of His Word.\n\nEditor’s Note: In Romans, Paul is building a case for the good news that is ours in Christ by faith. He uses these early chapters to establish our guilt before God—which he does to establish our need for a Savior. One of the most challenging aspects of the gospel is that it is based on the death and resurrection of Christ, necessitated by our own sin. We cannot understand the depth of God’s love for us in Christ without understanding the depth of our need for that sacrifice and the sin it covers. Because of Jesus, our sin is not counted against us, so we are never just “sinners.” We are redeemed sinners. A new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). What an amazing gift it is to know that “God proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).\n\nThis essay was revised on August 28, 2017. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 3:21-31, Ephesians 1:7-10, Colossians 1:13-14\n\nI love a good “before and after.”\n\nWhether it’s watching the last ten minutes of an episode of HGTV’s Fixer Upper or following a designer’s Instagram feed, I just can’t get enough of those visual transformations. Give me all the before-and-after shots of your kitchen, bathroom, closet—even your hair!—magically morphed from cluttered to clean. I never, ever tire of them.\n\nReading Romans 3:21-31 reminds me of my makeover obsession. These verses are all about our “after”—who we are because of God’s grace “by the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (v.24). The power of this passage lies in its contrast to the one before it. What would an “after” photo be if we never saw the “before”?\n\nA beautiful kitchen is a beautiful kitchen. But when we see that kitchen as it once was—dated tile, linoleum floors, and missing cabinet doors—compared to its transformed state of marble countertops and hardwood floors, we appreciate its newness and beauty that much more.\n\nSo let’s back up to Romans 3:20, our “before” shot that says, “For no one will be justified in his sight by the works of the law, because the knowledge of sin comes through the law.” That’s bad news for us. It means all the good stuff we did last week, all the good deeds and hard work—it’s all meaningless in itself.\n\nBut…\n\nBut now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the Law and the Prophets. The righteousness of God is through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.\n\n– Romans 3:21-22\n\nThis, friends, is the good news! No, we are not justified by the law, but we are justified in Christ.\n\nGod presented him as an atoning sacrifice in his blood, received through faith, to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his restraint God passed over the sins previously committed. God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be righteous and declare righteous the one who has faith in Jesus.\n\n– Romans 3:25-26\n\nNow, imagine knowing this good news with no understanding of the bad news that preceded it. Imagine seeing the “after” without seeing the “before.” It wouldn’t really be good news then, would it? In light of the bad news, the promise found in verses 25-26 is that much brighter, more hopeful. The contrast is everything.\n\nOur before is not a pretty picture. It is devoid of God and, therefore, full of despair. As Paul quoted the Hebrew scriptures, “all have turned away…ruin and wretchedness are in their paths” (Romans 3:12,16).\n\nBut…\n\nThis passage today is our after. The ones who have faith in Jesus are righteous. Not the ones who do the most, achieve the most, or follow the letter of the law the best. Unlike those HGTV makeovers, it’s not the amount of work we put in that brings us from before to after; it’s Christ’s work on the cross that transforms us. He, and He alone, declares us righteous before the one true God.\n\nPerhaps this is why I love seeing visual transformations so much. They help me to remember the gospel’s redemption in my own life. It’s a reminder I desperately need to hear, over and over again. It was not our blood, sweat, and tears that brought us back into relationship with God. It was His.\n\nWe are forever grateful, Jesus.\n\nAndrea Lucado is a freelance writer, Texas native, and the author of the memoir English Lessons: The Crooked Path of Growing Toward Faith.

I know, first telegrams were all the rage, later to be followed by fast food drive-thrus, “The Electric Slide,” and space travel. But now we’ve finally peaked with an affection for curly leaves that sprout from the ground.\n\nAt first, I really thought I was missing out. Kale seemed to be every celebrity’s best kept secret, every magazine’s healthy choice, and every grocery cart’s consistent companion. So, I tossed a bunch of kale into my produce bag and raced to the checkout line, anxious to taste this treat of the century. In the car, I tore the stem off like a cupcake wrapper, stuffing a handful of leaves into my mouth. I wanted to like it more than anything, but friends, gag reflexes don’t lie.\n\nIn contrast to the controversial kale, it would be difficult to find someone who didn’t like Abraham. His popularity was well-deserved, his reputation flawless, his character impeccable. The Jews looked up to him as a forefather paving the trail of faith, a man whose righteousness, they hoped, would inspire their own. If they were anything like me, they’d stuff themselves silly with anything that promised a chance at gaining his status.\n\nPerhaps some Jews tried to duplicate Abraham’s righteousness with their own try-hard attempts at earning favor with God. But no matter their determination, the results would remain bitter and unsavory. Exhausted, they might look to him and wonder, How does he do it?\n\nI asked the same of my friend Amanda, who eats a salad for lunch every single day and, consequently, is very well versed in the area of all-things-kale. She laughed, explaining that no one eats kale plain. Apparently (you probably already knew this), you drench it in dressing, blend it in a smoothie, or soften it with olive oil. By itself, kale isn’t the star ingredient, but when covered in other flavors, it gets all the credit for being delicious. Abraham’s secret had a similar flavor: “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness” (Romans 4:3).\n\nAt first glance, it’s easy to assume that if anyone could achieve righteousness, it would probably be a guy like Abraham. But like you and me, he had sin pumping through his veins. And so Abraham is not the achiever in this passage—God is. Abraham simply believed God and His promises.\n\nNow to the one who works, pay is not considered as a gift, but as something owed. But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who declares the ungodly to be righteous, his faith is credited for righteousness.\n\n– Romans 4:4-5\n\nHear this good news, friends. Because Christ was righteousness in our place, we, too, are drenched in His goodness, credited with His coveted status—we’re the very fragrance of Christ before our Father (2 Corinthians 2:14). May we always believe with the faith of Abraham, receiving God’s promises with open hands and thankful hearts. Amen.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 5:1-11, Galatians 4:6-7, Ephesians 2:18-22\n\nSeven years ago I found myself so emotionally, physically, and spiritually debilitated that just getting out of bed in the morning was difficult. I’d never struggled with acute depression before, but after soldiering through the deaths of several of my loved ones and a cancer scare of my own, my get-up-and-go was totally gone. All I wanted was to wave a white flag at life and crawl under the covers, venturing out just long enough to grab another pint of ice cream.\n\nIf someone had given me some perky acrostic or suggested I listen to a sermon entitled, “Ten Things Victorious Christians Do to Kick Disappointment and Despair to the Curb,” I’d have kicked them in the shins. Fortunately, Lynn, the Christian counselor I’ve gone to for years, doesn’t prescribe the dangerous meds of “minimizing grief” or “multiplying guilt.” Instead, she was silent as I sobbed, empathetic as I lamented.\n\nLynn gave me this advice: “Cling to Jesus and do the next right thing.” \n\nShe told me to stop trying to tackle the troubles of an entire day, much less a week, month, or year. I was simply to move forward one step at a time. Some days I’d wake to the alarm clock only to be hit with a shock of emotion as I remembered my circumstances. And other days, just whispering the name of our Savior gave me enough grit to pull back the covers and get out of bed.\n\nDay by day, inch by laborious inch, Jesus led me by the hand through that dark valley of life— one step at a time. \n\nI know far too many people who have lost their joy and all but lost their faith in Jesus because endurance was an overlooked muscle group in their Christian vocabulary. And so they’d stop attending Bible study, then church, fading away from their faith community in the midst of their malaise. Some have been wounded by that very same community of believers. Others have simply lost the energy and will to put on a happy face, to pretend their get-up-and-go hasn’t left them too.\n\nSurely our Creator-Redeemer weeps over the gaping holes in the fabric of His covenant family. We weren’t created to be wincing, jaded isolationists. We were created in God’s image, in the image of the triune God who exists in perfect relational harmony with Himself as Father, Son, and Spirit (Genesis 1:26). We’re hardwired for relationship, for communing with others of the faith.\n\nWhen life leaves us disappointed, disillusioned, and despairing, we need to resist the urge to withdraw from the body of Christ. Instead, we need to move toward other passionate—albeit flawed—Christ-followers to walk with us toward healing. We need to be honest with them, with God, and with ourselves about the true state of our hearts. We need them circling around us, crying out, “Abba Father!” on our behalf, reminding us of the Truth: we are no longer slaves, but daughters of the one true God (Galatians 4:6-7).\n\nTogether, we can persevere toward the living hope of the Lord Jesus Christ to whom we’ve been called. \n\nOnly God can love us unconditionally. Hoping in Him will never disappoint us the way the world does time and time again. Because “God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit” we can learn to rejoice and hope again, even in our pain (Romans 5:3,5). But it’s only in clinging to Him that we will find the strength to move forward in faith, one step at a time.\n\nLisa Harper is a master storyteller with a masters of Theological Studies from Covenant Seminary.

She’s been in vocational ministry for 30 years and has written 15 books (her latest being, The Sacrament of Happy: What a Smiling God Brings to a Wounded World) and Bible study curriculums but says her greatest accomplishment by far is that of becoming Missy’s (her adopted daughter from Haiti) mama!

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 5:12-21, Genesis 3:17-19, 1 Corinthians 15:21-22\n\nSometimes, the weight of living this life just gets to us. It feels sticky and scratchy, less graceful and more gritty. We wander into and out of seasons that leave us asking where God is in the middle of grief or loss or emptiness. \n\nA few weeks ago, I lost my grandfather slowly and suddenly. He was tired one day and hospitalized the next. Not three weeks later, he was gone.\n\nIn those days between admitting him to the hospital and him meeting Jesus, I couldn’t seem to rectify the fact that what was happening felt so foreign and yet so expected. Death is a terrible reality that we live with, an awful and haunting sort of event that wrecks us. But, as we learn early on, it’s inevitable: death is a part of life.\n\nOne night, as I was adjusting his oxygen mask, my fingers combed through his hair, damp with sweat because his breathing was so labored. It reminded me of my nieces waking from a nap, their fine hair damp and sticking to their foreheads. And then I thought of my grandfather as a young boy, running around, playing and sweaty. His mother must have pushed his hair off his forehead, just as I was doing now.\n\nLater, after he was gone, a friend would remark to me, “You know, we labor into this world and we really labor out of it, too.”\n\nOne evening around dusk, I pulled him up to a sitting position, and together we shuffled over to a chair by the window. I sat in front of him, asking question after question about his life. The vesper light caught his eyes as he told me about a career of flying planes all around the world for the Navy. We both knew things were drawing to a close. Still, in that moment, I sensed a very real peace. We both did. It was as if we both understood that our bodies may break down, but Christ has given us life that will carry on for the rest of eternity.\n\nPart of me couldn’t believe his earthly life was coming to an end. But another part of me knew better: this is what happens. Sometimes, we live so deeply rooted in our fallen, fragile reality that we forget there is another, better, truer one.\n\nFor if by the one man’s trespass the many died, how much more have the grace of God and the gift which comes through the grace of the one man Jesus Christ overflowed to the many.\n\n– Romans 5:15\n\nWhen I’m in the throes of hospital visits and errands and trying to make the best of every moment, I can forget the truth. Because of Jesus, life is more than survival or death. It is eternal (Romans 5:20-21).\n\nThese days since my grandfather’s death, I’ve been thinking about how, as a Christian, I live a life marked by beautiful disagreement. Even when it seems death is the only option, the life and light of Christ finds a way to break through. Even when 21 shots are fired and a flag is folded graveside, there is still hope. Even as we watched the setting sun one last time together, we saw the beauty in the darkness.\n\nEven in death, grace reigns.\n\nMelissa Zaldivar is a social in the world of academics and an academic in the world of socials.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebekah Lyons\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 6:1-14, 2 Corinthians 5:18-21, Colossians 3:1-11\n\nMy daughter was baptized a few months ago.\n\nShe decided to follow Jesus in her elementary years, and considered baptism a long while until she entered middle school. The week prior, a pastor from our church sat down in our kitchen to talk to her about the weight of this decision. She was choosing to publicly testify Christ as her Lord to anyone who asked. This was a commitment to follow and serve Jesus no matter what, even when it was difficult.\n\nThe following Sunday she wrote a letter to Jesus, just between them, and pinned it to a wooden cross at the front of our sanctuary before taking her turn in the waters. As her daddy lowered her beneath the water he offered the words, “buried with Jesus in the likeness of His death, and raised to walk in newness of life” (Romans 6:4).\n\nScripture says we joined Jesus in His death when we were baptized. Death no longer rules over Christ Jesus, nor does it rule over those who believe in Him. What’s more, when we died with Christ, we were set free from the power of sin. “For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time.” As believers in Christ Jesus, we are to “consider [ourselves] dead to sin and alive to God” (vv. 9-11).\n\nBut if we’ve truly died to sin, why do we continue to live in it? The act of sharing in Christ’s death wouldn’t be a one-time thing any more than taking communion would be a one-time thing. In fact, we’re told to examine our hearts before we take the bread and the cup (1 Corinthians 11:27). We ought to examine our hearts in everything and invite God to search our hearts too (Psalm 139:23).\n\nWhen we take a lackadaisical approach to our sin, we give it room to rule over us, to distract us. As those who have been crucified with Christ, sin is no longer our ruler. We are not under the law but under grace (Galatians 2:20; Romans 6:14).\n\nThis begs the question: What in my life needs to die each day? What has become an idol, a security, a focus, or a prop that has pushed God aside? I never seem to see sin enter my heart until I hear it roll off my tongue—a little sarcasm here, a critique there. Then envy soon follows, before resentment settles in and camps out. \n\nFor starters, my pride needs to die. It needs to die a thousand deaths. It’s the temptation of the religious leader to get puffed up by our words, thinking the message is ours. But the truth is that God has planted His Word in our hearts (Hebrews 10:16). We are simply called to speak His Word when summoned.\n\nThere’s something else that needs to die for me in this season: production. It’s time for me to get quiet after a long season of pouring out. Making room for the death of an idol opens wide the gates for a new beginning, a new imagination for what God will bring about in the days ahead. I’m walking out these days with an expectant heart, putting my ear to the ground, and listening for a fresh refrain of reverence.\n\nI wonder, is there something that needs to die for you today? When you are joined in Christ’s death through faith, you are also raised with Him in newness of life. Laying down your idols will open the floodgates for freedom to reign once more, making room for new life to spring forth again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 6:15-23, Galatians 5:13-14, 1 Peter 2:11-17\n\nWhen I was in elementary school, I decided I was going to grow an apple tree in our backyard. I didn’t tell my family about it. I wanted to do it secretly so that one day when there was a blossoming apple tree growing out of my mother’s flower bed, everyone would be amazed and I could reveal that I had grown it.\n\nI hoarded an apple seed from an apple I had eaten earlier in the day and smuggled it into the backyard when no one was looking. I dug a shallow hole in the flowerbed, placed the seed inside, and covered it with dirt. Then I hoped for the best.\n\nIn our last Romans passage we learned that Jesus’ death and resurrection does not mean life is a free-for-all, or that we can live however we like because of God’s grace. It means our motivation has changed. We don’t live under the yoke of the law any longer; we live under the covering of Christ, and that gift of grace motivates us to live by God’s Word.  \n\nIn Romans 6:15-23, Paul gives us another reason why Christians should not continue to sin simply because grace is now at play: fruit.\n\nBefore you knew Christ, Paul says, you were slaves of sin (Romans 6:17). And “…when you were slaves of sin, you were free from allegiance to righteousness. So what fruit was produced then from the things you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death. But now, since you have been liberated from sin and have become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification—and the end is eternal life!” (Romans 6:22).\n\nWhen we interpret the message of grace as permission to continue sinning, we miss out on living a life that bears fruit, and instead, we live lives marked by death, for that is what sin is. This is not only harmful to our own souls; it is harmful to our witness. First Peter 2:12 says, “Conduct yourselves honorably among the Gentiles, so that when they slander you as evildoers, they will observe your good works and will glorify God on the day he visits.”\n\nOur lives do not bear fruit in order for us to look good to others. Our lives bear fruit so that others will see it and know its Source. A fruitless life does not point to our Creator. A fruit-filled one glorifies Him with each step we take (John 15:8).  \n\nYou can probably guess what happened with my apple seed in the backyard. Absolutely nothing. While I had the big idea right—apple seed leads to apple tree—I went about it all wrong. If you really want to grow an apple tree in your backyard, it’s much more complicated than burying a seed and hoping for the best. I looked it up. The real process involves things like “germinating” and “grafting” and transferring the plant from various-sized pots until it is ready for the ground. Then maybe, hopefully, your tree will grow and bear fruit.\n\nI eventually forgot all about my apple tree. Days, weeks, and months went by, and since nothing was growing, I forgot about the seed and my little secret plan. It had been a fruitless effort because I had not properly cared for its growth.\n\nOh, that my Christian life would be the opposite of that poor, non-existent apple tree, that I would live motivated by grace so that others would see a life in full bloom, and that its beauty would point them to its source.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Annie Downs\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 7:1-13, Proverbs 1:19, John 14:6-7\n\nMy buddy Andrea wrote yesterday’s post, and I loved it. But no offense to her, sometimes real, live fruit can show up without much planning. Here’s what I mean.\n\nI follow one of my favorite Instagram accounts specifically for the Insta-stories. One account I adore is of an incredibly fun mom living in Florida. Last week, she did three or four videos of the same tree: an avocado tree. Hanging from the branches were dozens of avocados.\n\n“Look at these beauties!” she yelled to the camera, “And my husband takes all the credit for this tree!”\n\nApparently, a few years before, he’d planted the pit of an avocado there in the backyard, just behind the pool, and voila! AVOCADOS! He didn’t plan it or even care for it. Just planted the pit once the original avocado was eaten and then didn’t think about it again.\n\nJust a dead pit. Buried in the ground.\n\nWhat viewers like me saw was the tree—the product, the fruit grown from the death. But the part we didn’t see were all those days in the middle. The dead days. The days where nothing grew and nothing changed on the outside, but everything was changing on the inside.\n\nI need to see the avocados. And I need to see the dead days too. Because I feel them. Don’t you? There are stories in my life that just plain feel dead. It feels like I did all the work I knew to do, and yet nothing seems to be growing or changing.\n\nBut death brings life. So it is with us because of Jesus.\n\nTherefore, my brothers and sisters, you also were put to death in relation to the law through the body of Christ so that you may belong to another… (Romans 7:4).\n\nTo be a Christian means that we belong to Jesus. And He belongs to us. Our sin was there on the cross. Our flesh was crucified with Him. And when He went to the grave to conquer death, He took our sin—our past, present, and still-to-come-future sin—with Him and buried it all there.\n\nAfter those three dead days had passed, Jesus came back, fully alive, and brought us, His made-new creation, with Him (2 Corinthians 5:17).\n\nI’m not a huge avocado fan, but I can see an object lesson when it’s before me. So I went to the grocery store, found two avocadoes that felt ripe-ish, and bought them. I didn’t have a plan—I just knew I needed them.\n\nI got home, sliced one open, and no kidding, the minute I saw the pit I started crying. Because I saw it, right there in the middle, the death that had grown life and sustenance. I pulled it out with a knife, washed it off in the sink, and just held it. And prayed.\n\nI asked God about all the avocado pits I see in my life, things that look dead. And I asked if they were ever going to grow into something that mattered. Did they matter? Did He even see them?\n\n…You belong to him who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God (v.4, continued).\n\nWhile the Holy Spirit whispered truth to me, I already knew it; I saw it there in the avocado. Of course, He sees it all. He alone brings life from death, even when it feels like no new fruit will ever will grow in those dry, barren places.\n\nI breathed a prayer of thanks. And then I made guacamole.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 7:14-25, Galatians 5:16-26, 1 John 1:8-10\n\nSure, I was terrible. But it was the fruit flies’ fault.\n\nI’d been at war with them all week, using every trick Google assured me would work. Bowl of vinegar mixed with dish soap? Done. A trap made of fruit and plastic wrap? Yep. Pour diluted bleach down the drain and hope for the best? Affirmative.\n\nI’d done all the entire internet knew to do, to no avail. The fruit flies were multiplying, not disappearing, and I was over it.\n\nI was trying to cook dinner, plotting against the irritating insects in the interim as the pasta boiled and the sauce simmered. I was annoyed—and not just at the state of my kitchen, but at what seemed to be the state of my life. Why couldn’t I just get it all under control already?  \n\nThat’s when David walked in.\n\nI married a good man. He is kind and gracious and funny. And when he walked in the door during my fruit-fly and general-life crisis, I did what any human being would do: I let him have it.\n\nI was as passive-aggressive as I knew how to be and then some. I started slyly with some innocent questions, and then I went in for the kill, attacking his actions and decisions and, in the end, his character. It was awful. I was awful.\n\nHere is what I cannot for the life of me understand: I had no desire to treat my husband with such unkindness and disrespect. I did not stand there in my kitchen, stirring that spaghetti sauce and thinking, When he gets home, I’m going to give him a piece of my mind. Honestly, I don’t know that I’ve ever thought that about him.\n\nI love David. And I love how he loves me. I want nothing but the absolute best for him. But my best intentions were not calling the shots that night. My humanity was.\n\nI’m so grateful for this passage in Romans 7. I’m grateful that God not only knows us fully, but He reassures us of this in His Word. I’m grateful for Paul’s confession that so clearly articulates the struggle I feel in my own heart on a daily basis.\n\nI don’t want to sin. Really, I don’t. But I do it anyway.  \n\nI want to obey the Lord. Really, I do. But I disobey anyway.\n\nPaul’s description of his own sin struggle in Romans 7:14-25 can seem confusing at first read. But read it again, slowly this time. Read it aloud. Do you hear the desperation? Paul, like me (and like you?), does not want to sin. But in and of himself—in his “flesh”—he does not have the ability to be sinless. And he seems pretty frustrated about this. I am, too. Aren’t you?\n\nSin is a disease we are born with but cannot heal. Sin is a slavery we are born into but cannot escape (Romans 3:23; 1 Corinthians 15:22).\n\nSin is a condition we cannot fix. But Jesus can. He has.\n\nThe message of the gospel of Jesus—the gospel that causes Paul to cry, mid-frustration, “Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (v.25)—is that Jesus has rescued us from “this body of death” (v.24). We are more than just our weak-willed bodies; we are souls who have been redeemed by the sinless life and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\n\nYes, we struggle with sin. We struggle to “keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:25), to choose a moment-by-moment life guided by the Spirit of the Lord rather than our selfish desires. But we do not struggle in vain. Our struggle is a fight—a fight to live in the freedom that has already been secured by the Savior who defeated darkness once for all (1 Corinthians 15:55-57).\n\nThanks be to God, for He invites us into a life governed not by our wants or our whims, but by His truth and love.\n\n",

And soft, two-ply toilet paper—that was even more rare. When I brought her home to Tennessee, flushing the toilet with copious amounts of Charmin quickly became one of her favorite pastimes.\n\nHow darling!\n\nThat was my thought in those early days as I observed her wide-eyed delight at watching massive plumes of paper spiral downward. But after a while, wading through ankle-deep wastewater in my bathroom and writing large checks to repairmen lost its allure.\n\nSo I was at my wit’s end a couple months ago when I walked into my bathroom—past my innocent-looking daughter splashing in a bubble bath—slipped on the wet tile, and quickly discovered water gushing out of the commode like Niagara Falls. After a heavy sigh, I morphed into the put-upon persona my mother used when I did something especially naughty as a child:\n\nDoggone it, Missy, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU not to use giant gobs of toilet paper like this?!\n\nI angrily set about cleaning up the mess. The entire time I was plunging and fussing and mopping up that yucky pond with beach towels, I had my back turned to Missy.\n\nAs the water and my irritability subsided, I turned around to see my precious little girl staring at me mournfully, big tears streaming down her beautiful brown cheeks. I’d all but crushed her spirit over something innocent and insignificant. She wasn’t trying to cause a mess. She hadn’t been willfully disobedient or disrespectful. This was a plumbing issue—not a heart issue.\n\nI lifted her out of the tub, dried her off with our last dry towel, and rocked her back and forth until she stopped crying. I carefully explained that it was wrong for Mama to raise her voice, that I’d made a very bad choice, and that I was so sorry I’d hurt her feelings.\n\nThat night I called my contractor, who seemed perplexed when I asked, “Hey, Jack, you know those really powerful toilets on cruise ships that sound like they could suck your leg off when you flush them? Can you install one of those in my bathroom?”\n\nLess than forty-eight hours later, our brand-new supersonic vacuum version of a toilet was installed. I cheered so enthusiastically after Missy’s inaugural flush, you’d have thought she’d won an Olympic medal.\n\nOur recent toiletastrophes have reminded me just how much I love, value, and cherish my little girl. They’ve also reminded me of how God the Father loves, values, and cherishes me, His kid.\n\nI’m overwhelmed by the beautiful, redemptive ways He’s moved in my life. How He chose a former Haitian orphan, who lost her first mom to AIDS and never knew her biological father, to effectively rip out the last stubborn roots of the orphaned, fatherless spirit that have been growing in my own heart since long before I was Missy’s age.\n\nFor those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory\n\n(Romans 8:14-17, NIV).\n\nChildren. Heirs. Coheirs with Christ.\n\nGod continues to employ my unlikely, only-by-grace, position of motherhood as a constant, colorful illustration of how He cheers Himself hoarse over every ungainly cartwheel we do (Zephaniah 3:17). How He leans down and hangs on every word of our mostly narcissistic prayers. How—despite our proclivity to make huge messes—He is so completely for us.\n\nLisa Harper is a master storyteller with a masters of Theological Studies from Covenant Seminary.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebekah Lyons\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 8:18-25, Isaiah 65:17, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Revelation 21:1-6\n\nIt begins as far back as we can remember. Right before we run off to school, we smear on our mama’s lip gloss and clamp down as many hair clips as our endless bangs will allow. We hope for another attempt to fit in with the others, to measure up, to belong.\n\nGrowing up, I often found myself hanging in the balance between enjoying the moment and anticipating the next one. As a young child, my hopes centered around a 25-cent soft serve ice cream cone after church on Sunday nights. My hopes matured as I did—working to make the swim team, racing to the finish line at a track meet, striving to win an award. I hoped for slumber party invitations, a certain new sweater for Christmas and, of course, beating my brother at checkers.\n\nThose early years of putting my best foot forward, I hoped the appearance of having it all together would win me friends. But years down the line, the stakes of life loomed larger, and deep heartache entered in—nevermind the lip gloss or hair clips.\n\nIn truly tragic moments, our hope is put to the test. And if it’s misplaced, it will be found wanting. \n\nThe hope we read about in Romans offers us a greater understanding of the hope God offers. It takes us from tangible evidence we can see, and pushes us deeper into a faith that asks for what we cannot see. In fact, all of creation is wired for this. If something breaks, we are hardwired to figure out a solution. Most problems can’t be solved in a day, so we work and test and try until we receive the desired outcome. But there will always be a hope offered by God that requires all of Him, and no amount of our working and testing will bring it to pass. This is the hope of Christ, our Rescuer and Redeemer.\n\nBecause of Christ, we are free to hope in even the most difficult or uncertain circumstances. In the first chapter of his epistle, James tells us to “consider it a great joy” whenever we face trials because the testing of our faith produces spiritual endurance (vv. 2-3). Trials are accompanied by hope. Hope is a gift. Hope is critical, and the gospel gives it to us in unending supply.\n\nNow in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? Now if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience (Romans 8:24-25).\n\nAny suffering we endure here and now is incomparable to God’s coming glory (Romans 8:18). The measure of trials we have endured directly relates to the measure of hope we offer the world. This is the beautiful gift of hope.\n\nOne day our groans will give way to glory. While we wait, we place our hope in Jesus.\n\nHe will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more, because the previous things have passed away (Revelation 21:4).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 8:26-39, Psalm 44:17-22, Philippians 1:6, 2 Thessalonians 2:14\n\nI hope your summer fun list includes a trip to an amusement park or two. Nothing gets the blood pumping quite like circling a track at 100 miles per hour while simultaneously crying, laughing, and screaming. That’s good stuff.\n\nBut before you fill the water bottles and load the kids into the minivan for a day of sweltering, screaming fun, I need to let you in on a secret your brain already knows.\n\nIt starts with a feeling sociologists call “museum feet.” It’s a phenomenon our brains experience when we’re in a big space like an amusement park or a museum. It’s a general sense of being lost or exhausted that comes from hanging out in such a large space.\n\n“Museum feet” could give park-goers a bad experience, causing them to leave the park and not return. But architects have learned that if they include a large visual landmark, we’re less likely to become overwhelmed. They’re looking out for us, and their bottom line, by ensuring we’re willing to stay on the grounds long enough to fork over the cash for overpriced lemonade and nachos.\n\nThink about it: Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World. Spaceship Earth at Epcot Center. The 150-foot “Big Wheel” Ferris wheel at Six Flags. Each offers their own brand of fun, sure, but they also give a reference point to come back to, something to focus on when we feel overwhelmed, overtired, or just over it.\n\nPaul never made it to Disney World, but he must’ve known a thing or two about feeling anxious, overwhelmed, or disoriented. Here, in Romans chapter 8, he shoots up a flare of truth for the believer to come back to every time we feel the same.\n\nAnd we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28).\n\nIf this is one of those feel-good verses that’s become so familiar you’re tempted to race past it—STOP. This is the mother lode, friends! If God can use all things for our good and His glory, nothing can knock us off kilter. He makes us sure-footed. It’s the kind of steady posture that caused Paul to restate the truth of Romans 8:28 for the church in Philippi.\n\nI am sure of this, that he who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus (Philippians 1:6).\n\nPaul is describing the process of redemption—that supernatural metamorphosis whereby God makes all things new. Paul was so anchored in the gospel that no wind could capsize him. That’s not new news, but this may be: the steadiness of Paul is possible for us too.\n\nGod’s promise in Romans 8:28 means He’s already at work, reshaping everything for our good. Tribulation, persecution, famine—God can redeem all of these and more (v.35). Nothing can stop the redemption process (vv.38-39). Not death, not life, not angels or rulers. Not this moment or all the tomorrows to come. Nothing can stop God from working all things for good—not even you.\n\nLife is big. It’s easy to feel lost or overwhelmed or like we want off the ride, but God’s truth anchors us against museum feet. The story of redemption gives us a point to come back to when we feel alone or afraid. The next time you feel overwhelmed, overtired, or just plain over it, look up. The same cross that steadied Paul in the face of unthinkable trials will steady you.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 9:1-19, Exodus 32:30-32, Ephesians 1:3-6\n\nYou’ve probably been there—that terrible moment when you feel like you’re watching a train about to wreck. Your roommate chooses to stay in a toxic relationship. Your child makes a series of self-destructive decisions. Your brother or sister persists in a state of total denial. Your friend walks away from God.\n\nHelplessness is a special kind of agony, especially when it comes to our loved ones. This is the agony Paul expresses in Romans 9 about the choices of Israel. Having had his eyes opened to the light of the gospel, Paul realizes with great anguish that many of his people—God’s people—have not awakened to the good news of Jesus Christ. Theologian N. T. Wright describes Paul’s reaction this way: “[Paul] was like someone driving in convoy who takes a particular turn in the road and then watches in horror as most of the other cars take the other fork.”\n\nPaul’s sorrow is so great that he would rather take their place: “I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the benefit of my brothers and sisters” (v.3). This chapter, then, is not a cold, calculating explanation of Israel’s history and fate. Instead, Paul is wrestling with the mysterious ways of God, and he doesn’t arrive at many neat and tidy conclusions.\n\nIn Romans 9, Paul engages some complex theological questions, but if we zoom in a bit and look at his heart, we might recognize our own. Most of us have walked in Paul’s shoes—grieving the rebellion, blindness, or self-destruction of someone we love. From Paul’s own wrestling with heartache, we can discern two spiritual principles:\n\n1. None of us can boast. None of us stands on moral high ground. God’s grace was not extended to us on the basis of human merit, but divine mercy. That is the principle Paul points to throughout the history of Israel: Isaac, not Ishmael; Jacob, not Esau. These men, these chosen ones who constituted the line of Abraham, were not selected because of their outstanding moral character, but because of the free compassion of God. As Paul explains, “It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy” (v.16). In other words, none of us can pat ourselves on the back for our good choices or our strong faith, while silently judging others. It is all a gift, so that none of us should boast.\n\n2. God is sovereign. The relationship between God’s power and our free will is a mysterious one, indeed. But when it comes to the decisions of a loved one, God’s sovereignty removes a great deal of weight from our shoulders. Namely, we cannot force someone to make the right choice. We cannot yell someone into wisdom. We cannot wrestle someone into agreeing with us. And we cannot compel transformation. There is only One who directs the streams of human hearts, and that is God alone.\n\nThe sovereignty of God does not permit us to become callous, nor does it permit complacency. Like Paul, we should mourn destruction whenever we encounter it. But it can relieve us of a burden we were never meant to bear.\n\nOnly God knows the whole picture and the entire story. Our task is to share the good news to the best of our ability, in humility, and then prayerfully leave the rest to Him.\n\nSharon Hodde Miller is a writer, speaker, pastor’s wife, mom, and she holds a PhD on women and calling.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 9:20-33, Jeremiah 18:1-6, Ephesians 1:11-14\n\nI did an internship in Washington D.C. the summer before my junior year in college. The job was good enough; I coordinated summer camp logistics for kids interested in politics. Yes, it was as nerdy as you’re imagining, and yes, I was a former attendee. But the best thing about that summer wasn’t licking envelopes and herding hormones. It was meeting a new group of friends at church.\n\nI don’t know if you’re familiar with the town of Stars Hollow from the TV show Gilmore Girls, but those quirky, fictional characters had nothing on my new, real-life friends. Despite the fact that I was a stranger in town, and only planning to stay for eight weeks, they grafted me in, constantly hounding me to join them for weekend adventures of camping, floating down rivers, or taking long motorcycle rides through the Shenandoah Valley. It was as dreamy as it sounds, and healing for my soul in many, many ways.\n\nWe talked about the gospel, too, and one of those conversations led to the topic of the providence of God—what some call “predestination.” The candor of the conversation shocked me. Who talks about this stuff anyway? And what does the providence of God even mean?\n\nI was kindly pointed to today’s passage in Romans, and from there one friend explained the idea that God knows, plans, and orchestrates everything. All the days ordained for me (and you, for that matter) were written in His book before one of them came to be (Psalm 139:16). We are God’s workmanship created to do good works that He prepared in advance for us to do (Ephesians 2:10). Salvation itself is a righteousness that comes by faith, and even that comes from Him.\n\nAt face value, the concept that God is in control of everything might seem offensive. We humans have a cosmic authority problem. We don’t like to believe that Someone else has the final say in our lives. When Paul asks in Romans 9:20, “Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’”, I want to scream, “Yes! That’s what my prayers to God sound like on a regular basis!” But if we are to take Romans 9 to heart, we have to concede that God is ultimately the one in control of His creation.\n\nIn the years since my dream summer in D.C., I’ve learned a lot about faith. I’ve read much more of the Bible. I’ve spent countless hours with Jesus. And despite all that, God’s providence is as mysterious to me now as it was then. But I do know this: I would rather believe in a loving God who is fulfilling His purpose for me, than a cosmic universe that is inflicting its chaos on me.\n\nI look at the seasons, coming and going in their time. I look at the ocean waves, which know their boundaries. I look at my face in the mirror—imperfect, yes, but a masterpiece in the Master’s hands. I look at the miracles of birth and life and death. None of it is a mistake. This beauty is His creation, and He is sovereign.\n\nIf we trust Him—if we believe His love—we can put away our questions of Why did you make me like this? and put on the posture of Thy will be done.\n\n Claire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

I was a senior in college, involved in campus ministry and leading a Bible study, and I enthusiastically updated her on both endeavors. I’d begun telling yet another story when she calmly interrupted me with a simple, matter-of-fact statement: “You believe in a works-based gospel.” \n\nWe’d known each other a while, and her statement stunned me. Was she serious? \n\nI quickly brushed it off in the moment. But later that week, I found myself kneeling by the side of my bed, soaking my plaid, purple bedspread with tears. She was right. \n\nThere I was, wallowing in my sin, wanting desperately to be back in the loving arms of my Savior. I had asked for forgiveness, but the relief wasn’t coming. As I poured my guilty conscience onto the pages of my journal, I was struck by one word: time.\n\nThat’s what I thought I needed: time. I didn’t really want forgiveness. I wanted time—enough time to fill my life up with the right things, the good things, to settle the score. It was salvation by works at its worst. \n\nAll my striving, all my desire to put time between myself and my mistakes, it was another attempt to earn my salvation through my own effort. Rather than trusting the work of Christ on the cross for my righteousness, I had become dependent on my own actions to save me.\n\nI was living exactly like the Israelites Paul describes in Romans 10:\n\nSince they are ignorant of the righteousness of God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to God’s righteousness (v. 3).\n\nAfter Christ’s death and resurrection, Israel was still working hard to keep the Law of Moses in order to gain righteousness. They were working to save themselves, forgetting that “Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes” (v. 4). \n\nThe law, our works, the right things—they were never supposed to save us. God had planned our salvation and redemption through Jesus Christ all along. Christ is the only perfect fulfillment, the only victory we have over sin and death. His perfect life allows us to be justified through our faith alone. Faith and nothing else, just Jesus—this is the message of Christ.\n\n“For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (v. 13). \n\nAs I knelt beside my bed that day, I realized Jesus truly was all I needed. His sacrifice covered me then, despite all my striving, and it covers me today. I need His righteousness, not my own. He is enough. \n\nFriends, no matter what our past, present, or future holds, the only work that can save us is the work Christ completed on the cross. May we call on His name.\n\nOne believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation (v. 10).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 11:1-24, Hosea 14:4-7, Ephesians 2:8-9\n\nThe first time I read Romans 11, I saw God as very kind. \n\nBut today, that kindness seems far away—30,000 miles below me, to be exact. This time, I’m reading Romans from seat 12B, squished between two strangers. And the pilot has just warned us that “significant turbulence” is ahead. \n\nA hush fell over the cabin in that awkward “I’m playing it cool” kind of way. Because it’s totally going to be fine. I mean, how likely is that whole “unlikely” in-case-of-an-emergency situation, anyway?\n\nWe’re all eyeing the flight attendants to gauge their uneasiness.\n\nJust when you’ve settled into your seat and become comfortable with God’s kindness, the winds shift. His tender mercies can also feel severe. Regardless of how much we show it, we’re all afraid of crashing.\n\nThe Romans were afraid of this too. After all, Israel had taken a hard fall following God’s rejection, so it only seemed natural for this band of new believers to begin bracing themselves for a similar emergency landing. They were afraid that if God didn’t turn out to be who He said He was, they’d have to take matters into their own hands. \n\nIt’s in moments like these that sweet songs about God’s kindness and goodness do not trump the truth about His severity. Just like we need the fullness of God’s character, we need to know the fullness of His Truth.\n\nAlthough the pilot reassures us that everything is under control, I’m tempted to entertain anxious questions. Did they check the plane to make sure it was safe before we boarded? Is the pilot keeping something from us? Is everything really just fine?\n\nWhen bad things happen that we don’t understand, are we just naïve to keep hoping? Will God reject us like He rejected Israel? It’s when we face the unknown that we find out how well we trust God’s character… which brings me to Jello.\n\nCreated by pilot and therapist Captain Tom Bunn to illustrate turbulence, the Jello Exercise compares a plane’s high-traveling, air-thickening speeds to being encased in Jello. While turbulent bumps may make you feel like you’re falling from the sky, it’s actually more like tapping the top of a Jello mold: the plane can bounce up and down, but it cannot fall. In fact, it barely moves at all. Regardless of the bumps, the plane is sustained, completely, by a force we can’t even see. \n\nSo are God’s people.\n\n“Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, though a wild olive branch, were grafted in among them and have come to share in the rich root of the cultivated olive tree, do not boast that you are better than those branches. But if you do boast—you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you” (Romans 11:17-18).\n\nIt is by grace that we cannot fully comprehend what it takes to sustain us. Not only does God know exactly what it takes, but in His kindness He sent Jesus to endure the severity for us. When love isn’t taken lightly, grace must also be severe.\n\nIt takes an intense, thickening wind to keep a plane steady in the clouds. It takes a kind, severe God to sustain us for His glory. Today, He is not only kind, but also severe, and exactly Who we need.\n\n“The people will return and live beneath his shade. They will grow grain and blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon” (Hosea 14:7).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 11:25-36, Isaiah 40:13-15, 1 Corinthians 12:4-11\n\nPerhaps you’ve heard the not-so-fairy-tale-like stories of the children of Israel. Like the one where God rescued them from slavery, and they responded by grumbling about the flavors missing from their menu (Numbers 11). Or the one where they got impatient with Moses as he met with God on Mt. Sinai, so they decided to worship a golden calf (Exodus 32). Or the time when they came to the border of the promised land and listened to their knees knocking and hearts racing, instead of listening to the voice of God (Numbers 13).\n\nWhen we flip forward in our Bibles to the New Testament, we find God’s people still stuck in the ruts of rejection and rebellion. It was, after all, the Jewish leaders who led the charge to have Jesus arrested, tried, convicted, and crucified (Matthew 26:3-5). After the resurrection, they remained resolute in their opposition of Jesus, doing everything in their power to squelch the message of the Church. \n\nYet here in Romans 11, Paul reminds us that despite their chronic grumbling and wilderness wandering, despite their golden calf worshipping and Savior scourging, the Jewish people remain God’s “beloved” (v. 28). \n\nOur human logic may balk at this, but Paul warns against trusting only what makes sense to our brains (Romans 11:25). Try as we might, we cannot understand God’s love using our flawed standards for love and acceptance. Chapter after chapter, verse after verse, the story of God’s commitment to His chosen people doesn’t make sense. Human understanding leaves us wondering, Why did God choose them? But through the lens of the gospel, the story of the Jews suddenly makes sense. Look at Deuteronomy 7:6-8.\n\n“For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth” (v. 6).  \n\nLean in. Listen closely to this next part. \n\n“It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all the peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath he swore to your fathers. . .” (vv. 7-8).\n\nGod knew His beloved were weak and frail—incapable of keeping their side of the covenant. Still He chose them, loves them, and keeps His promises to them. \n\nThe Bible is not the story of a wayward people but of a faithful God. \n\nIn the shadow of the cross, we are God’s chosen people. Because of the gospel, our identity has been changed from “not my people” to “my people” (Romans 9:25). Christ’s sacrifice made a way for us to be among the “beloved.” The gifts God has lavished upon us are so extravagant, and we are so undeserving, that we sometimes worry He’ll take them back. But “God’s gracious gifts and calling are irrevocable” (Romans 11:29). \n\nThe depth of God’s wisdom is matched only by the depth of His love. He has promised unfathomable gifts to us and He will never snatch them back. If every one of God’s acts of love and faithfulness toward the Jewish people could be contained, they’d overflow the seas. We, too, can stand on the shore and see the unmistakable faithfulness of God. \n\nWe are weak.\n\nWe are wayward. \n\nAnd yet, the Prince and the kingdom are irrevocably ours.\n\nErin Davis is an author, blogger, and speaker who loves to see women of all ages run to the deep well of God’s Word.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 12:1-8, Hebrews 13:15-16, Ephesians 4:1-16\n\nPersonal discipline isn’t one of my stronger giftings. To put it another way, I stink at it.\n\nI’m the one in my family who excitedly asks, “Who wants to go get ice cream?” rather than stick to our sensible meal plan. I’m notorious for drafting a shiny new routine that lasts for three days before I’m ready for spontaneity again. Despite my best efforts to implement structure in my life, I’m all over the place. I’ve come to accept that flexibility is just part of who God made me to be.\n\nBut here’s the truth. For me, that acceptance spills over into a lack of spiritual discipline. The world tells us that fulfilling our every desire or whim in the moment is a sign of happiness, success, and freedom. But I can say from experience that ignoring spiritual disciplines only leads to chains, not freedom.\n\nPaul warns us, “Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,” and I find myself staring longingly at his words (Romans 12:2). I want that. I want my body—my whole self—to be “a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God” (v. 1).\n\nI tried renewing my mind by attending church, but I didn’t make time to engage with God at home. I’d sit half-dazed in front of my computer, reading about fall fashion trends rather than reading my Bible. I’d watch one more episode of my favorite show and skip my prayer time. I wanted to read my Bible and pray and live out Romans 12:2, but my propensity for distraction and gluttony grew. I couldn’t control them on my own, no matter how guilty I felt or how many times I vowed to change.\n\nI’d forgotten that only God can transform my heart. And that transformation takes place in the context of the body of Christ, His Church—not just out here on my own, accompanied only by my best intentions.    \n\nMaybe your struggle is the opposite of mine, and routine and productivity are the desires that take the place of true renewal. Or perhaps your days are bound by a structure that you don’t want God to bend, a rigidity where spending time with Him in Scripture and in prayer are items on a checklist rather than intimate interaction with your heavenly Father. Whatever your personality, spiritual disciplines are tools that lift our eyes from our circumstances and desires and focus our hearts on God’s presence. Prayer, fasting, Bible study—they’re all disciplines that renew our minds and refresh our spirits. But unlike a resolution, a diet, or an exercise regimen, they aren’t sustained by our willpower.\n\nTrue spiritual growth is rooted in the Spirit’s work in us, not in our effort. God is the Giver. We are the recipient. He empowers. We surrender. We do this individually, as God’s daughters and sons, and we do this corporately, as His children and Church.\n\nMay we truly worship the Lord today by offering Him our whole selves, surrendering our desires to His will and our efforts to His strength, “according to the grace given to us” (Romans 12:6). Amen.\n\nJill McDaniel is a northern girl who married a southern gentleman and settled in the Midwest.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 12:9-21, Matthew 5:44-47, 1 Corinthians 4:6-13\n\nReading Paul’s list of exhortations to the Romans makes me tired. Seriously. Rid your life of hypocrisy. Love deeply. Outdo one another in showing honor. Do not lack diligence in zeal. Share with the saints. Pursue hospitality. Live at peace with everyone…\n\nWith everyone? Really?\n\nDude. Paul. I need some coffee. And also, when am I supposed to binge-watch my TV shows?\n\nIn all honesty, when I compare my life to the lives of the disciples, I begin to see why Paul fills 1 Corinthians 4:6-13 with so much irony. I practically live like a queen compared to Christ’s beloved friends back in the day, and compared to much of the world today. Most of my time is spent concerned about how I’ll choose to spend my time.\n\nI catch myself daydreaming about the life the world tells me I should have: a life with a passionate (never rocky) marriage to my soulmate, a clean and immaculate house, a career that’s advancing, children that are thriving, and plenty of time at the gym maintaining the body of a teenager. To top it off, the world tells me I need to portray this “perfect” life to the world on social media, to attract more followers.\n\nWith this world as my guide, adding Paul’s list to the mix is absolutely impossible. There are not enough hours in the day to do both what the world demands of me and what God desires for me. And so I have to choose.\n\nEvery single day I have to choose whom I will serve: my flesh or my God. Some days I make the right choice. Some days I make the wrong one. This is the life of a work in progress, one that God promises to bring to completion in His time (Philippians 1:6).\n\nPerhaps that’s why Paul tells us to “cling to what is good” (Romans 12:9). If good was an easy, simple thing to hold onto, why would he tell us to cling to it? I know that in my own life, if I’m not clinging to God, the natural inclination of my heart is one of jealousy, coveting, and destructive daydreams. So while it seems like what Paul is cautioning us to do should be obvious, I know it to be oh-so difficult to put into practice. Detest what is evil; cling to what is good. I know that If I’m clinging to something, then I’m desperate, grasping. I’m holding on for dear life.\n\nThese passages remind me that my very life is at stake, and that evil really is evil. Paul pokes at my carefully built life, reminding me that Christ’s path of goodness and stillness and quietness is the only route to peace. I can rest knowing that the battle is the Lord’s. But I can’t assume that rest and peace will come without effort on my part, without my choosing God. I must cling to Him and let go of everything else.\n\nDear Lord, help me to hold on.\n\nClaire Gibson is a freelance writer and editor whose work has been featured both locally and nationally in publications including The Washington Post, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 13:1-14, Daniel 2:19-23, Hebrews 11:32-40\n\nThe Bible is filled with the stories of people who have defied authority. Moses stood up to Pharaoh then led the Israelites out of Egypt. Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego all refused to worship any other god but Yahweh—and were then thrown into the lions’ den and fiery furnace, respectively. (Spoiler alert: God saved them all, and for His glory.)\n\nStephen defied the ruling Jewish Council, preached the gospel of Jesus, and was stoned to death for it. Paul and other apostles were martyred by the Roman government during the persecution of Christians.\n\nAnd yet this same Paul, who likely later died at the hands of his government, urges believers to honor and respect those in authority. Paul—who knew many examples throughout Jewish history of standing up to corrupt rulers—says to obey, seemingly without question. What are we to make of this?\n\nOf course, it’s natural to wonder, What if the government was urging murder, stealing, or some other form of not loving one’s neighbor? What if the ruling authorities were, as Nebuchadnezzar did, asking their people to bow down to another god? Or no god at all?\n\nScripture has given us plenty of evidence that Christ is the ultimate authority in heaven and on earth. Paul isn’t contradicting that here. What he is doing in Romans 13, is laying down a foundation for Christian living—reminding us that our ultimate authority is Jesus. Our first and truest loyalty is to Him.\n\nPeter gives a similar exhortation in 1 Peter 2. After telling the people, “you are a chosen race, a holy priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession” (v. 9), he says:\n\nSubmit to every human authority because of the Lord, whether to the emperor as the supreme authority or to governors as those sent out by him to punish those who do what is evil and to praise those who do what is good… Honor everyone. Love the brothers and sisters. Fear God. Honor the emperor (vv. 13-14,17).\n\nPeter starts by reminding believers of who they are: the body of Christ, a holy nation of God that extends beyond borders. This is a beautiful truth for us to cling to as well, especially in times of deep confusion, national partisanship, and turmoil within our own institutions.\n\nBoth Peter and Paul tell early Christians to honor their government, but they do so in the context of the whole story of Scripture (and their own writings), affirming that Jesus is Lord over all. Therefore, we obey the government when it doesn’t contradict God’s commands—and we do it joyfully, as a way of honoring God.\n\nJohn Piper says it this way: “And it is very important to stress that, just as we may have to disobey the civil authorities for Christ’s sake, so all our obedience should be for His sake as well. We never have two masters … Every time we say yes to any law, it should be a yes to Jesus.”\n\nOur every action should be motivated by our identity as followers of Christ and citizens of God’s kingdom:\n\nThe night is nearly over, and the day is near; so let us discard the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. Let us walk with decency, as in the daytime: not in carousing and drunkenness; not in sexual impurity and promiscuity; not in quarreling and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and don’t make plans to gratify the desires of the flesh (Romans 13:12-14).\n\nThe Bible offers many examples of what godly citizenship looks like in an earthly kingdom. Let us pray continually that we will seek first God’s Kingdom, listening to the promptings of the Holy Spirit as we engage thoughtfully with our own earthly governments. \n\nMelanie Rainer is the director of content for JellyTelly, where she writes and edits family spiritual formation resources.

Tonight my friends and I are headed to watch the Nashville Sounds play minor league baseball. There, I will hug everyone too many times, introduce friends who don’t already know one another, drink multiple Coke ICEEs, and maybe catch a foul ball. Then I will fall into bed tonight sure that I’m the luckiest woman alive.\n\nMy life is far from perfect. But the life I’ve spent 37 years putting together is turning out alright. Not perfect, not problem-free, but pretty awesome nonetheless.\n\nThe older I get, the more I draw boundaries in my life, making it the life I want to live. Some of my life rules wouldn’t work for you, and I’m okay with that. For starters, I’m dairy-free (it’s an allergy thing), but I wouldn’t ask you—or any of my friends at my birthday party—to live without milk, let alone eat cake WITHOUT ice cream. That beautiful stuff should never go to waste!\n\nThen there’s the matter of rest. My day off each week is almost always a Wednesday. That doesn’t mean it needs to be your weekly day to rest. It simply means Wednesdays work best for me.\n\nAnd then there’s the soccer. I watch it every chance I get. But you don’t have to do the same. Though, I’d highly recommend it because it’s just the best. Period.\n\n The beauty of maturing, and also growing up in my faith, is that I no longer want to look like you. In high school I wanted to look like you, sound like you, and like what you like. Not now. Now, I want to live MY life. I want to look like me—the best, healthiest, kindest, truest version of me. There’s this thing we get to do whenever we’re tired of comparing our lives to other people’s lives: we get to live our own.\n\n You know what it is? It’s the difference between bondage and freedom. Freedom is not a life without boundaries or borders or rule. It’s a life full of the good kind of boundaries, the kind that keep you healthy and strong, living the life God made you to live. It’s the life that is uniquely yours.\n\nFor none of us lives for himself, and no one dies for himself. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord (Romans 14:7-8).\n\nWe often think freedom as just wide open space. But I’ve never found that to be true. Real freedom is found in knowing Jesus. It is giving yourself permission to live wide open in the spaces where God has placed you and in the ways He has made you. My fences around my spaces are going to look different from yours, but there is such safety and health and permission inside the boundaries built just for you.\n\nScripture tells us that if we’re Christ-followers, then the life we get to live belongs to Him  anyway. Galatians 2:20 says, “The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.”\n\nThat right there—living for Jesus—is living your best life.\n\n \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 14:13-23, 1 Corinthians 8:8-13, Ephesians 4:25-32, Ephesians 5:1-2\n\nI’ve always heard this passage in Romans 14 interpreted according to clothing, music, alcohol, smoking, and more—all in terms of “not being a stumbling block for others.” I was tender to my power to be a stumbling block of every sort, both to the believing and the unbelieving, checking over my shoulder to see the carnage I’d left in my wake. Truth was, I left hardly any, but it didn’t stop me from metaphorically cutting off arms and legs, gouging out eyes and the like, in pursuit of protecting my brothers and sisters.\n\nThe Christian life, I thought, was more about what I couldn’t do than what I could.\n\nHow glorious, then, when the true gospel began to take root in my heart. I began to understand that freedom in Christ meant I was truly free to live. As it turns out, Christ had declared me more than clean. He’d declared me redeemed.\n\nFor all the ways I’d formerly applied this passage, though, the one I’d not considered was food. I knew all food had been declared clean, that we’re no longer under the law of Moses in our dietary restrictions. But what I didn’t understand was the law of our current world with regard to food: the diet and exercise industry. Everywhere I look, the acceptable Christian message of caring for the temple of the Holy Spirit turns into what I imagine Paul might’ve called the “god of the belly” (Philippians 3:19).\n\nIn Philippians 3, Paul warns of the dangers of gluttony. But today, in modern culture, the opposing god—though a no less despicable one—is the one who demands less food, more restrictions, better supplements, flatter stomachs, tighter abs, and the list goes on. In an attempt to care for the temples of the Holy Spirit with eating and exercising, we can destroy our bodies (which are wasting away, whether we like it or not) and cause harm to the impressionable hearts and minds of others who jump on every new regime or diet we offer.\n\nWe want to be well, to eat healthy, whole, good food. We love the rhythms of feasting and fasting we see in Scripture. We want to move our bodies, staying limber and active. But we don’t want to destroy our hearts by lusting after what we don’t have: slimmer physiques and sculpted thighs. We don’t want to destroy our bodies by rebounding from one quick-fix supplement to another. We don’t want to destroy our minds by believing our approval comes from certain lifestyles or appearances.\n\nThere are countless difficulties in life, opportunities to be divided over race, gender, theology, and history. And food, instead of becoming a means to crush those divides—to draw near to one another, armed with soups, fruits, breads, vegetables, and meats—has become one more line of division.\n\nChrist died for all; this is what the Bible says. I don’t want to be known by what I eat or don’t eat. I want to be known by how I love and Who I’m loved by.\n\nSo then, let us pursue what promotes peace and what builds up one another. Do not tear down God’s work because of food (Romans 14:19-20).\n\nWhatever struggle you’re caught in the throes of today, know that you are loved by Christ. He spread His own body, bleeding and broken, to fit a cross you could never bear on your own. Don’t destroy your own body by what you do or don’t eat. Christ died for all—every curve, every bulge, and every stretch-mark—all of it.\n\nFor “the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit” (Romans 14:17). God gives us food as a means of provision, not division. Instead of fostering false divisions today, let’s bake a cake, make a soup or a sandwich, and share it with someone in the pursuit of peace.\n\nLore Ferguson Wilbert is a writer, thinker, and learner.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Guest Writer\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 15:1-21, 2 Samuel 22:50-51, Psalm 117:1-2\n\nSome of my fondest memories as a kid include long summer days spent at the pool. These memories are filled with flipping off the diving board, shouting “Marco Polo,” and of course, playing King of the Mountain. The goal of King of the Mountain was to be the only one on top of the raft, ruling your kingdom by any means necessary. Growing up with brothers, I had to be scrappy and strategic to win at this brutal game. From a young age, I learned that only the strong survive.\n\nI’m told that as a grown-up, it’s not cool to push people off rafts at the pool. The thing is though, we still want to be on top. We just have different rafts now, and we’ve learned to defend our turf in more covert, “polite” ways. \n\nSo much of how we respond has to do with the season we’re in. When we’re treading water, we hope and pray for a gracious hand to help us onto the raft. But when we’re on top, it’s easy to become prideful in our position. It gets especially ugly when we believe there isn’t enough room on the raft for everyone. Even in the Church, we can foster the belief that the kingdom of God only has space for the “good” people, whether we’re conscious of it or not. \n\nIn our reading for today, Paul was writing to a Roman church comprised of two very different people groups: the Jews and the Gentiles. Even from its earliest days, it seems there were divisions amongst the believers in that region. Those who were “strong” didn’t want to help those they considered weak. But Paul challenged the Romans to accept one another, just as Christ had accepted them (Romans 15:7).\n\nPaul points out that even the strongest among us, Jesus Christ, did not use His power to please Himself. If anybody had a right to boast it was the Lord, yet He took our weakness upon Himself to the point of sacrificing His very life. \n\nWe are all in need of God’s grace. In that humility we can seek to be like Jesus, freely passing on the strength and encouragement that has been gifted to us. If the Lord of the universe humbled Himself and bore our weaknesses, how much more eager should we be to do the same for those whom He’s placed around us?\n\nIn addition to following the sacrificial example of Jesus, Paul also calls the Roman church to accept one another for the glory of God. When we’re competitive and exclusive in our churches, how do you suppose we’re seen from the outside? Our witness is compromised by our selfishness. But if we’re a countercultural people and can demonstrate with love and sincerity that there is room at the table of God, then we will have something divinely different to offer.\n\nIt’s tempting to believe the lie of this world, that we must fight to be on top. But in the kingdom of God there is always enough for everyone. As believers, we’re called to lay down our lives for others just as Christ did, to love both the strong and the weak. If we stop trying to protect our little rafts, together we will glorify and join in celebration with the one true King, who lives and reigns over all the mountains. \n\nKaitie Stoddard is a professional counselor who recently relocated from Chicago to Colorado with her husband.

I think constantly about what works and what doesn’t. In short, plans are my jam.\n\nIn my final year of seminary, a job opportunity arose. It was one of those really great, safe jobs that worked in all the practical ways. I would have a plan—in case, you know, God didn’t come through. I walked through the interview process until the final meeting, when we were to discuss terms for my employment. That morning I confessed to God that I was more concerned about my five-year plan than His plans for me. Then I did what I knew I had to do: I walked into that last interview and said, “This is just not where I need to be.” \n\nAt first, I felt amazing, like that scene in The Devil Wears Prada where Anne Hathaway throws her cell phone into the fountain. Life felt extraordinary, like I was jumping off of the proverbial cliff of my ordinary, planned-out life into the unknown. Later, as I sat alone, it hit me: I had no backup plan and only a few months until graduation. Panic set in, and I did what most of us do in crisis. I told absolutely no one that I was struggling.\n\nOne Sunday, my friend Laura cornered me at church. She barely had to acknowledge the look on my face before I spilled my doubts and fears of being a failure and a fool. I felt shame. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t even know how I was going to buy groceries that week.\n\nLaura didn’t miss a beat. She saw past the facade and grabbed my arm, looked me in the eye and said, “I don’t have an answer for you. But I can tell you that God is with you. Even when you can’t believe that, I’ll believe it for you.” Laura reminded me of the blessing that is mine as a follower of Jesus—a peace greater than my plans. \n\nPaul’s life was filled with adventure and excitement (think: shipwrecks and jail time) but he, too, was created for community. In Romans 15:23-24, he writes, “I have strongly desired for many years to come to you whenever I travel to Spain. For I hope to see you when I pass through and to be assisted by you for my journey there, once I have first enjoyed your company for a while.” In these moments we catch glimpses of Paul’s ordinary life, even in the midst of extraordinary journeys. \n\nI imagine he felt lonely at times. I wonder if part of him didn’t want to admit his own struggles. \n\nIn a moment of need, I didn’t even have the words to ask my friend to pray for me. But Paul’s letter reminds me that gospel community is the life we’re called to. Paul knew firsthand that when we experience fellowship within the body of Christ, we are experiencing the very kingdom of God. “I know that when I come to you,” he said to his fellow believers in Rome, “I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ” (Romans 15:29). Then he asked for their prayers. \n\nMay we be a people who confess aloud how much we need Jesus, and push one another back into His presence. We don’t simply write postcards from a distance and wish one another luck or prosperity. No, we have the honor of inviting each other to encounter the living God, the giver of salvation and peace.\n\nMelissa Zaldivar is a social in the world of academics and an academic in the world of socials.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 16:1-16, John 13:16, 1 Peter 5:14\n\nOf all of the roles I’ve had in my life, my least favorite, without a doubt, is “new girl.” \n\nShe’s clumsy and uncertain, always draining her phone battery with GPS directions to the grocery store and back home again. With brave intentions and shy tendencies, she’s perfected the art of introducing herself, yet allows her next-door neighbor to call her the wrong name yet again. She doesn’t know when trash pickup is or where to find the office break room. And her best friend, states away, knows she’s always on call for both late night and early morning pep talks.\n\nI’ve been the new girl enough times to know what makes her feel welcome. Paul has a pretty good idea, too. After all, he could have easily ended the book of Romans with chapter 15, one of the biggest mic-drop opportunities of all time. Instead, he reintroduces us to the gift God gave us in each other. \n\nAfter “amen,” Paul continues on with a crucial reminder: we are not alone. He introduces us to his friends by name, explaining their significance and telling us why we’ll love them. \n\nPhoebe, whom Paul reminds us is already our sister, is on her way to Rome (and may be the one carrying his letter!). He encourages us to befriend her and take care of her during her stay. Priscilla and Aquila, more dear friends, put themselves on the line for our buddy Paul. So, of course, we’re honored to greet them and their church. The list goes on and on, and as it grows, Paul continues to build up God’s people with encouragement, delivering each name as a lifeline to the full body.\n\nIn this intimate portrait of Paul and his fellow believers, we see a lasting truth: The body of Christ is a built-in reminder that redemption is an extraordinary reality for everyday people. \n\nIt’s easy to misread the Bible as “The Book of People Who Had It All Together,” when really, there’s only one Hero in this story. The simple truth is that we all need Jesus, and we all need each other. \n\nIn Romans, Paul emphasizes that God’s plan is good news. But his writing isn’t just for well-versed theologians—it’s for ordinary, faithful people living in small, unseen obedience. It’s for us. If you are in Christ, your name is written there among the greatness and glory of God’s plan.\n\nHere in our temporary home, we never stop being the new girl who needs to relearn grace and remember truth. But praise the Lord—we don’t have to do it alone. \n\nGreetings, friends. And peace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus (1 Peter 5:14).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nScripture Reading: Romans 16:17-27, Matthew 7:15-20, Jude 24-25\n\nI took a personality test the other day, and I wasn’t thrilled with the results. It confirmed what I already knew: I avoid conflict like the plague. Put me in a tension-filled room and I’ll moonwalk away so fast, you’ll never even know I was there.\n\nI tell you this not to confirm that I was raised in the 80s (which I was), but so you’ll understand why I so desperately want to misinterpret today’s passage from Romans. I’ll show you what I mean.\n\nHere we’ve come to the close of the longest of Paul’s letters. We’ve heard him preach on sin and salvation, grace and faith, and now we’re leaning in to see how he’ll land the plane. What does one say to wrap up what would become known as the most comprehensive expression of the gospel in all of Scripture?\n\nHe begins his conclusion with a warning:\n\nNow I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who create divisions and obstacles contrary to the teaching that you learned. Avoid them… (Romans 16:17).\n\nThis is where my comfort-loving ears perk up. Steer clear of those who cause problems? Avoid conflict at all costs? If that’s what our friend Paul is selling, I’m buying in bulk. But he continues:\n\n…because such people do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites. They deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting with smooth talk and flattering words (v. 18).\n\nNo smooth-talkers allowed? Yep, works for me.\n\nIn my humanity, I want Paul’s words to leave me right where I am: a well-intentioned gal who doesn’t like to rattle or be rattled. I want a divine endorsement for a head-down, hands-off way of living. I want to look to the folks on my right and my left and say, I’m fine. You’re fine. Everything’s fine. In short, I want to read Paul’s words as permission rather than admonition.\n\nHe keeps writing:\n\nThe report of your obedience has reached everyone. Therefore I rejoice over you, but I want you to be wise about what is good, and yet innocent about what is evil. The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you (vv.19-20).\n\nCrushing evil is not a passive activity. Our holy and sovereign God is currently and constantly at work, overcoming darkness with light (John 5:17). As Christ followers, our work is not passive either. We are called to right doctrine and right living—to cling to Christ and to His gospel, shunning all false gods and gospels that beg our worship. This is Paul’s parting reminder.\n\nIt’s true that I’m predisposed to being a coaster—a person who’d rather stay the course than question questionable coordinates. But the gospel Paul presents in this letter is not a matter of right or left. It’s a matter of life and death. The mystery of Jesus Christ has been “revealed and made known through the prophetic Scriptures, according to the command of the eternal God” (Romans 16:26). Our Savior has come. He has opened the way to God, the rescue and restoration of our wrecked, restless souls.\n\nThe truth is, you and I are not fine. We “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). But in God’s great love and compassion, we have been “justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Romans 3:24). What’s more, “since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). \n\nThis is the gospel. This is our hope. \n\nThis is what we cling to, what we live by, what we fight for—to the glory of the One who created us, saved us, and calls us His own.\n\nTo the only wise God, through Jesus Christ—to him be the glory forever! Amen (Romans 16:27).\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Daniel’s Captivity in Babylon",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Amanda Bible Williams\n\nLast week my husband called to say goodbye to his 93-year-old grandmother. Her body is showing signs of fatigue, and her doctors have said she doesn’t have much time left. More than that, she can just sense it somehow.\n\nHe relayed the conversation to me afterward—how he told her would miss her, and how she said she loved him and called him “Doo-bug,” the name she gave him when he was a baby. I listened, the familiar ache in my chest of knowing that our time here is temporary, no matter how we like to pretend it isn’t. What must it feel like to know the transition to heaven is near—to look back over nearly a century of celebration and sorrow, wars and babies, grandchildren and church potlucks and conversations on the front porch? What does success look like from that vantage point? What does it mean to live a faithful life?\n\nIn the book of Daniel, we get an overview of one man’s life. This true story begins with God’s people, including young Daniel, being taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon (Daniel 1:2). Part of the king’s strategy was to take some of the most beautiful, wise, and noble into his own home and indoctrinate them in the ways of the Chaldeans. The Babylonians’ desire was to change everything about Daniel, from his name to the god he worships.\n\nThe book recounts Daniel’s roughly seventy years in exile. He will be a prophet, an interpreter of dreams, and a prisoner. He will fast, worship, and pray to the God of Israel under threat of his life. He will survive a den of hungry lions by Yahweh’s power and presence, and prophesy the glory of God’s eternal kingdom. And while we know Daniel was not perfect—he was human, a sinner in need of grace—we will get glimpses over these twelve chapters of what it looks like to live a faithful life in exile.\n\nWe, too, are exiles in this world, longing for the day when we will live at home in the presence of Christ our King. We are citizens of heaven, but we take up residence here for a time, called to represent God’s image on every stretch of the journey. As we wrestle with what it looks like to live a faithful life, we look past Daniel to the perfection of Jesus Christ. He is our example and our advocate, our just judge and righteous ruler.\n\nTo say this year has been disorienting is an understatement. But regardless of our times, our culture, or our circumstances, our God’s faithfulness endures and His character does not change (Hebrews 13:8). He is more than able to be our anchor in times like these. If we will turn to Him and choose His ways, He will help us to remain faithful in this life, looking forward to the day when we will no longer feel the exile of this world because we will be with Him in His eternal kingdom.\n\nLong live the King.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Alena Pitts\n\nDo you ever wonder what it means to be favored by God? Or do you ever think about what it looks like to have God’s hand on your life? I thought I knew, but the longer I live the more I realize my understanding of God’s favor is expanding.\n\nAt the age of ten, God granted me the opportunity to star in a Christian film called War Room. The movie was a box-office hit and has been viewed by millions of people all over the world. Two years later, God gave me the chance to write a three-book fictional series with my mom titled Lena in the Spotlight. Those books have sold thousands of copies all over the world as well.\n\nThese were two life-changing events that gave me the privilege of traveling all over the world to tell my story and share the hope of God. Now, at sixteen, I can easily look back and call that God’s favor.\n\nBut I need to be truly transparent and honest with you. When I was asked to write on this passage in the book of Daniel, I immediately felt unequipped and unworthy because there is more to my story.\n\nTwo years ago my beautiful mother unexpectedly passed away. She was my best friend. She was with me on the movie set, in my writing, and as I traveled sharing my story. Just two days before she died, we were speaking at a mother/daughter conference together. But then she left this earth really suddenly and entered into eternity. I was devastated. It was the most painful day of my life by far, and I still carry it with me.\n\nBut would you call me crazy if I called this God’s favor on my life? I wouldn’t have said that two years ago, but now I’m beginning to understand favor a bit differently, maybe more deeply.\n\nThink about it. Do you think Daniel wanted to leave his home country of Israel? Do you think he would have wanted to live in a land that wasn’t his, working for a king that wasn’t his, being asked to serve a god that wasn’t his? I imagine he was pretty saddened by how his life had changed so quickly. But with the blessing of time and perspective, we can see in our readings today how God’s favor was still with Daniel in all of that.\n\nAs devastating and heart-wrenching as reality can be, it can often be God’s favor. God’s favor could be anything He has done or allowed in your life in order to fulfill His ultimate purposes. And what is God’s purpose? That people would find Him in the midst of their lives, in their pain and struggle, and come to know that they are deeply loved by Him.\n\nWhat if, like Daniel, God wants to use your story to help others find Jesus? What if His favor can be found in the things that feel like blessings, as well as the things that are really hard? What if He wanted to use all of your life to show up in your story and lead others home to Him? Would you choose today to view all of it as His favor, working to fulfill His good purposes?\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nWhen my husband and I were debating where to attend grad school, I kept one prayer on repeat: “God, please make it abundantly clear where we should go.” I would have paid anything to know we were making the right decision as we logged thousands of miles on our car, traveling from state to state, and weighing pros and cons. Ultimately, God answered our prayer, just about as clearly as we could have hoped, and off to the midwest we went.\n\nBut I can count many, many more times in my life when I desperately prayed for a clear answer, and it felt like God met me with quiet and silence. Sometimes, God’s quiet feels empty and leaves me angry or desperate for answers. And sometimes God’s quiet feels like confidence, the kind of stillness that settles over a dark house at night, when you feel safe and at peace, but there is no sound.\n\nThe desire for a dream to be interpreted or for a sign to be made clear is everywhere in Scripture. Saul lost his kingship because of it (1 Samuel 13), Gideon tested God in a search for clarity (Judges 6), and even the Pharisees asked Jesus for a clear sign (Matthew 12).\n\nIn Daniel 2, King Nebuchadnezzar wanted a clear interpretation of his dream, and threatened all the wise men, magicians, seers, and sorcerers with death if they couldn’t provide him with that interpretation. Nebuchadnezzar was so troubled by his disturbing dreams and so desperate for answers, which we see in his willingness to reward or punish those who could potentially unlock it for him.\n\nBut no one could—no mystical prophet of the pagan gods, no wise man, no medium. The Chaldeans even declared, “What the king is asking is so difficult that no one can make it known to him except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals” (Daniel 2:11).\n\nBut Daniel, a wise man who knew the true and living God who did dwell with His people, had a different response. He called on the name of the Lord, who responded by giving Daniel a vision of both the king’s dream and its interpretation. Then “Daniel praised the God of the heavens” (Daniel 2:19), reciting a true and bold prayer, with promises still true for us today (vv.20–23).\n\nFor Nebuchadnezzar, for Daniel, and for us today—only God can unlock the mysteries of wisdom and understanding, because God is the true source of them. God answered Daniel’s prayer with abundant clarity, but He doesn’t always. Whether God writes His answer in the sky or (by our limited human understanding) seems to remain maddeningly silent, we can move forward with confidence and faith. The rest of Daniel’s story will testify to this truth and call us to a deeper knowledge of the God whose answers we can always trust.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jen Yokel\n\nIt was a matter of life and death. A recurring dream disturbed King Nebuchadnezzar’s sleep night after night. He called for the Babylonian magicians and wise men to explain it, threatening them with execution if no one succeeded, but Daniel, a Judean exile known for his wisdom and dream interpretation, prayed until God revealed the answer. And one day, he made his appointment with the king.\n\nIt wasn’t exactly good news.\n\nEach night, the king dreamed of a colossal statue made of various materials, from a solid gold head to iron and clay feet. Suddenly, a stone breaks from a nearby mountain and collides with the statue’s feet, causing it to crumble. The stone then grows into “a great mountain [that] filled the whole earth” (Daniel 2:35).\n\n“Your Majesty, you are king of kings,” Daniel truthfully tells the emperor. “The God of the heavens has given you sovereignty, power, strength, and glory” (Daniel 2:37). But the statue is a grim prediction. Babylon is the head of gold. Other, lesser kingdoms will rise and fall. But God, the heavenly “revealer of mysteries” (v.47), doesn’t leave this kind of power in human hands forever. “The God of the heavens will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed” (v.44).\n\nDaniel is a book full of mysteries and symbolism, politics and miracles. Yet the core truth is hope for an indestructible kingdom built on justice and mercy. Over and over, Daniel’s humility and loyalty to the God of his forefathers is contrasted with the arrogance of kings. Though his gifts made him influential, we don’t see a man tempted to play the power game. You can imagine him walking through the palace, serving royalty, and telling the truth with a homesickness and hope in his heart that whispers, “Someday… Someday, God will make this right.”\n\nCenturies later, Paul, another gifted exile, wrote this from the shadow of the Roman empire: “Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, when he abolishes all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign until he puts all his enemies under his feet” (1Corinthians 15:24–25).\n\nPaul paints a vision of God abolishing any authority that isn’t His, even death’s. Every empire that rises will someday fall. A reign built on violence and power can never truly last before a new ruler comes and tears it apart. But we can trust that God is building a mountain to fill the earth. God’s kingdom has been inaugurated by Jesus’s death and resurrection, because after all, “The last enemy to be abolished is death” (1Corinthians 15:26).\n\nGod, revealer of mysteries, shares the kingdom’s secret through Jesus’s life and resurrection. Daniel only had part of the picture, but he still carried confidence in an eternal kingdom—one of peace, laying down your life for your friends, and pledging allegiance to the only King who will reign forever.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Delivered from the Fire",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Tameshia Williams\n\nCourage under fire. We often encounter situations that require us to stand up for our beliefs, even at the risk of loss. We speak up about an injustice. We blow the whistle on unethical behaviors at work. We refuse to endorse societal values that clash with the truth of God’s Word. We perform these acts of bravery, knowing they can result in loss of our jobs, our relationships, and even our social standing. The pressure to back down can be tempting.\n\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego understood this pressure and refused to let even the threat of death sway them. God had their complete trust; they placed their fate in His hand. When faced with the fiery furnace that was meant to be their death sentence, they declared, “But even if [God] does not rescue us, we want you as king to know that we will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up” (Daniel 3:18). What a bold proclamation from these three young men in the presence of such a powerful king! They chose faith in God over fear of a human king. No matter how intense Nebuchadnezzar made the fire, the young Jewish men refused to abandon their trust in the Lord.\n\nTheir story gives us a powerful picture of what unwavering faith in God looks like in our own lives. We trust that He is with us, no matter what flames we face. We trust in Him when we are sick, encounter financial hardship, and even lose our loved ones. He promises to be with us through it all (Isaiah 43:2). And so even when the king made good on his fiery threat, God proved that He had not abandoned His faithful ones (Daniel 3:25).\n\nThe Lord can also use our faithfulness to change people’s thoughts and actions in ways we cannot even begin to imagine. Nebuchadnezzar marveled at the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego after witnessing their delivery from the fire, acknowledging, “There is no other god who is able to deliver like this” (Daniel 3:29). Even further, he passed a law that forbade anyone else from speaking against God. This allowed other Jewish exiles to worship God without fear of punishment. This all came about because three young men refused to give up their faith.\n\nAnd what about us? How do we respond when it seems as if everything and everyone is against us? We lean in closer to the one who refuses to abandon us. We trust that as we walk through the flames, He is with us every step of the way.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Nebuchadnezzar’s Proclamation",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitie Stoddard\n\nAt the core of our faith, we Christians believe that the Triune God is the one, true ruler of the universe. At least that is what we confess with our mouths. But if we’re honest, it’s not always how we order our lives, is it? If you don’t struggle with remembering that only God is God, consider yourself blessed with humility. But if you’re anything like me, it’s easy to slip into acting like you’re in control of your successes and failures—taking credit when things go well, spinning your wheels when things unravel.\n\nIt’s the original sin in the garden of Eden (Genesis 3), and the one that still haunts us today. When Eve grabbed the fruit, she grabbed at God’s throne. Despite the fact that she was living in paradise with her perfect mate, she wanted more. And we do the same: all too often, we grab at God’s power and we claim God’s glory.\n\nNot in an obvious way, though. Not like King Nebuchadnezzar who literally claimed he built Babylon by his “vast power” for his “majestic glory” (Daniel 4:30). Cue the eye roll. That guy was so full of himself, it’s hard to feel bad for him when he ends up eating grass (v.25).\n\nWhile we probably wouldn’t say anything that arrogant out loud, we harbor the same sin of pride in our hearts. Maybe that’s why things like the story of Nebuchadnezzar and the proverb’s warning that “pride comes before destruction, and an arrogant spirit before the fall” (Proverbs 16:18) always seem to spook me a little; because I know I’m a sinner, and I don’t want to wind up eating grass too.\n\nThank goodness, God is gracious. In His plan for Nebuchadnezzar, we see God intended to show the king mercy. God left the root intact when He chopped Nebuchadnezzar down like a tree. Daniel interpreted that to mean that God would restore Nebuchadnezzar as soon as he turned from his sin and proclaimed God’s rule (Daniel 4:26). This story is a reminder that God is more compassionate than we can imagine. Because we are covered by the blood of Jesus, “He has not dealt with us as our sins deserve” (Psalm 103:10).\n\nIn remembering God’s graciousness to me, I can’t help but remember what a better Lord He is over my life than I could ever be. We can serve our sinful selves or we can serve the most loving God. When we think about it that way, it’s an easy choice. God’s ways are so much better than our own (Isaiah 55:8–9). We can learn the hard way and find ourselves face down in the grass, or we can choose each day to proclaim the truth that “his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation” (Daniel 4:34). Therefore, “let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord” (1Corinthians 1:31).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey T. Hurley\n\nThe writing was on the wall: No matter how many clothes I purchased or how many beauty treatments I tried, I wasn’t going to get the fulfillment I longed for by my outward appearance.\n\nI’m embarrassed to admit that I often want women to see me and covet my style, my hair, my home decor. As a woman who loves Jesus, I often put my self-identity in my image and how “put together” people perceive me to be. It’s not just the clothes though; it’s the ability to juggle everything, balancing kid schedules and my own free time. It’s the way I can host a big party and make it look effortless. I even want the God-given opportunities of ministry to look like I do it all on my own. Never mind the privilege and good gifts God provides. I am quick to forget whose glory I am actually seeking: God’s.\n\nKing Belshazzar, like myself, also struggled with humility. After he was given the privilege and honor of his new role as king, he chose to exalt himself “against the Lord of the heavens” (Daniel 5:23).\n\nBefore Belshazzar, King Nebuchadnezzar lost his throne when he became arrogant and forgot God’s favor upon him. One would think Belshazzar would have learned from his predecessor’s mistake, but it is not until Daniel interprets the message God had sent that Belshazzar realizes his misplaced glory. Daniel tells Belshazzar, “You have not glorified the God who holds your life-breath in his hand and who controls the whole course of your life” (v.23). Unfortunately, it is too late for him; Belshazzar is killed and his kingdom is handed over to the Medes and Persians (v.28).\n\nI can’t judge King Belshazzar for wanting the glory for himself, for forgetting who gave him the position of authority in the first place. It’s so easy to forget who controls the whole course of our lives when we are so focused on what we want, when we want it. It can be hard to see the big picture when the things of this world seem so attractive and promise us instant glory. But it is not the things of this world that deserve our attention and worship because they are all “passing away” (1John 2:17).\n\nIt is God’s glory—whose dominion and power are greater than the greatest kingdom and whose influence reaches far beyond the reign of any king—that deserves our greatest attention. We will all fail like King Belshazzar by exalting ourselves over God and forgetting to acknowledge His power and rule over our lives. But we are also covered by the grace of Christ, which moves us toward a posture of humility. Each day we get to repent and choose to acknowledge God and give Him the worship He deserves.\n\nForget the latest fashion; I can clothe myself in humility and trust God to “exalt [me] at the proper time… because he cares about [me]” (1Peter 5:6–7). This is a glory that outweighs the attention of others, one that never fades. It is everlasting life in the kingdom of God with a perfect, loving, and kind King.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Abby Flynn\n\nHave you ever been in a lions’ den?\n\nFor most of us, the answer is probably NO, but metaphorically, that might be a different story. What I’m really asking is this: Have you ever been in a situation where you felt trapped, without options or a way out? Have you ever felt betrayed by the people you trusted? Have you ever wondered if God is big enough to pull you out of that difficult thing you’re facing?\n\nIn Daniel 6, the entire nation of Judah was in captivity. These people probably often felt defeated, yet they clung to the hope and the promise of a coming Messiah to save them. \n\nIn the midst of this, Daniel, a Judean, is working for King Darius and gains favor with him. The king positions Daniel for advancement, but this leads to jealousy from the king’s other administrators (Daniel 6:1–5). They knew Daniel served the God of Israel, which was in direct opposition to what the king had commanded. So they convinced the king to put an ordinance in place that anyone who chose to worship another god would be thrown into the lions’ den (vv.6–9). But instead of worshipping in secret or putting his faith on the back burner, Daniel continued praying to God publicly, despite the decree. \n\nThree times a day he got down on his knees,  prayed, and gave thanks to his God, just as he had done before (Daniel 6:10).\n\nThis clash between faith and politics resulted in Daniel being thrown into the lions’ den, even though the king desperately tried to save him. Once inside the den, the king tells Daniel to call out to his God for help. You see, even Darius recognized that Daniel’s God was living and active, something he saw by observing Daniel’s faith. The next morning, the king comes to check on Daniel, only to find he’s miraculously unharmed! (vv.21–22).\n\nHere’s what this story shows us: No matter how dire things may look, there is NO situation created by man that God cannot change (v.17). There’s no principality, no power, no earthly ruler, or law greater than the one true God. The whole book of Daniel gives us constant reminders of God’s sovereignty. To this day, God is still a rescuer, deliverer, and miracle worker, even when circumstances are difficult.\n\nSo what are you having a hard time trusting God for? What is the seemingly impossible situation that you’re sitting in with no clear way out? The pressure may be on. You may not see a light at the end of the tunnel. But you can trust that the living God is in the den with you. And He has the ability to “shut the lions’ mouths” (v.22), whatever that may be in your life. \n\nLord, today we ask that you would remind us of the promises in your Word. Help us to focus our attention on You, instead of fearing the circumstances around us. Tune our hearts to the things you want to show us, even in the lions’ den. Even now.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Ancient of Days and the Son of Man",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Elaine Phillips\n\nThe first part of Daniel’s dream vision was the stuff of night terrors. The four apocalyptic beasts were fierce predators, each more terrifying than the previous one. The four parts of the statue in chapter two represented four kingdoms; now Daniel saw their true nature. These rapacious creatures embodied the four brutal super-powers under which God’s people would suffer—repeatedly. While the stationary image signified the idolatrous world views of the dark kingdoms, the violence of these beasts exposed the lawless end product of idolatry, no matter what form it takes. God’s people should rightfully quail at the prospect. \n\nFor that reason, the second part of the vision is of utmost importance—for Daniel’s audience and for us.\n\nThe Almighty God is on His throne. What words can possibly capture God’s radiant and holy presence? God is surrounded by fire and flaming wheels, with an accompanying river of fire. Fire purifies. Woe to us indeed, if we fail to bow our faces to the ground in appropriate fear and dread; “our God is a consuming fire” (Hebrews 12:28–29). \n\nWhat can convey God’s absolute and everlasting rule of the universe? That’s the point of “Ancient of Days” and blindingly white hair and clothing (see Psalm 104:2). We must linger on these words and images that catapult us to the vaults of heaven. Far above all else that we may find tumultuous and terrifying, God reigns supreme, and God will judge. Daniel saw the books opened and those utterly fearsome beasts either subdued or destroyed.\n\nThen, the Son of Man arrived with the clouds of heaven, was ushered into the presence of the Ancient of Days, and was given dominion, glory, and power (Daniel 7:13–14). Everyone would serve Him, and His kingdom would never end. In other words, the Son of Man is God. \n\nJesus intentionally chose this title for Himself (Matthew 8:20; 11:18–19). His audiences might first have thought of Ezekiel, whom God repeatedly summoned with the words, “son of man,” affirming the prophet’s human nature, entirely given over to serving God. But they would also be familiar with this passage. Daniel’s “Son of Man” was invested with all the accoutrements of deity. By consistently calling Himself “Son of Man,” Jesus was affirming and declaring that He is both fully God and fully human. \n\nThat culminated in the exchange between Caiaphas and Jesus (Matthew 26:57–67). When Caiaphas put Jesus under oath, Jesus declared they would “see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven” (v.64). This one bold statement drew together this passage from Daniel 7 and King David’s words from Psalm 110:1—two key passages Caiaphas would have been well acquainted with, both of which unquestionably point to God and no one less. No wonder those religious leaders at Jesus’s trial tore their robes! \n\nMake no mistake, Jesus was declaring Himself God before those religious leaders who should have been anxiously awaiting His arrival. Their human judgment of Jesus is an ironic contrast with the image of God’s coming judgment in Daniel 7:9–10. Nevertheless, in God’s cosmic judicial proceedings, those events affected true justice—for eternity.\n\n",

Even Daniel was overwhelmed by his own vision. Daniel, the faithful Israelite. Daniel, the brave exile in Babylon. Daniel, the interpreter of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream. But even he couldn’t interpret this one. (Glad I’m not the only one confused.) Feeling terrified and exhausted, he asks an angel within the scene for an explanation. \n\nWoven into this account of Daniel’s vision is God’s reminder that it’s okay not to have all the answers. He gives us freedom to wonder and be uncertain. God invites us to prayerfully ask for help (Philippians 4:6–7) and to search for clarity (Psalm 119:12–16). However, the humbling reality is that we just won’t understand it all. For example, most scholars interpret the four beasts in Daniel’s vision as the empires of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, yet there is debate about which kings the horns represent, how the little horn specifically attempts to dominate, the timing of it all, and so on.\n\nThere’s a lot we don’t know, but there’s a lot we do know, too. We see these mighty empires puffed up with pride and self-sufficiency. They devour, crush, and trample as they oppress and conquer their neighbors (Daniel 7:19). What a picture of how humans behave like beasts when we reject our Creator! Individuals and societies disintegrate when we refuse to believe that every human is made in the image of God and deserves dignity. Seeking “my will be done” instead of “God, your will be done” diminishes our humanity. The ruthless kingdoms rise, then, inevitably crumble.\n\nThe angelic interpreter also tells Daniel that the ten horns represent kings who will rule after the fall of the brutal fourth kingdom. Daniel is especially horrified by another little horn that rose up to overtake the others. It represents a tyrannical leader who arrogantly rejects God, wages war against God’s people, and positions himself as a tyrant over all creation.\n\nYet, all is not lost. Horror gives way to hope as Daniel watches the ultimate reckoning unfold. A heavenly court convenes and God Himself, called the “Ancient of Days,” takes the judgment seat. The Judge rules; the verdict is in. All who have set themselves up against the authority of God are sentenced to eternal death. Then, one who looks like the son of man joins the Judge to accept the rule and reign of God’s kingdom of eternal life.\n\nWhile Daniel strained to see and understand this hope, we can look to Jesus, who called Himself “the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven” (Mark 14:62). Even though we don’t have all the answers, we can rest assured “that the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever, yes, forever and ever” (Daniel 7:18). World without end, from horror to hope… Amen!\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nI’m always looking for a way to get out of work. Lately, a global pandemic has proven an excellent excuse for me to close up shop by noon to put my feet up while I indulge in existential worry and consider rearranging my indoor plants. Maybe you like to give up a little on your kingdom work, too, when the future looks bleak. But let’s consider that our callings remain vitally important in spite of whatever germs, climates, powers, or terrifying bugs may be buzzing around us.\n\nBiblical prophecy usually has at least two applications: one specific interpretation and one related, general, big-picture meaning. Sometimes the specific meaning of the prophecy is revealed soon after the prophecy, and sometimes thousands of years elapse before the meaning is clear. Looking back, some of these prophecies look really obvious, like: “Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign: See, the virgin will conceive, have a son, and name him Immanuel” (Isaiah 7:14). But at the time of Isaiah’s prophecy, an immaculate conception didn’t make any earthly sense. The prophet often doesn’t get to enjoy an understanding of the prophecy. Here, Daniel is given a very specific vision and an interpretation. But he still could not understand it. \n\nDaniel sees a vision of judgment for sin. He sees an angry ram and a violent goat and absurdly large horns. He sees the result of sin running rampant in a civilization. And he asks, just as we might ask, “How long?” (Daniel 8:13). How long will this last? And the “holy one” answers with a finite number. In this case it is 2,300 days (v.14), but notice the number is a real, countable number. The big picture is that sin is sometimes allowed to flourish—but not forever.\n\nThe whole ordeal appalls and overwhelms Daniel. Understandably. But here’s the part we should really notice in particular: He “got up and went about the king’s business” (Daniel 8:27). The scary news didn’t make Daniel give up. The confusing and difficult revelations did not prevent him from holding on to what he did know, what he did understand. He took a minute, and then he went back to work. He got on his feet and did the good work the Lord had called him to. He engaged in the culture and continued doing his faithful work.\n\nEven when we feel afraid, even when we look to the future and dread wells up in our hearts, we know the most essential truth: God is on the throne. This is His creation and we, the Church, are His Bride. The angel tells Daniel, “Son of man… understand that the vision refers to the time of the end” (Daniel 8:17). The “end” will come. The suffering in the world is limited and finite. But we never need to fear the end. Remember how Christ spoke to His disciples of the end times, saying, “Be courageous! I have conquered the world” (John 16:33).\n\nThough we may, like Daniel, be “overcome and lay sick for days” (v.27) when we look at the state of the world, and wonder how it can all possibly come to good, we are called to remember that God is busy at work. Therefore, we can rise like Daniel, and go about the business that God has set before us. We can be of good courage, knowing that the end of the story is not the triumph of wickedness, but the victory of Christ. Truly, we are more than conquerors in Christ who rules and reigns forever. So take heart, and go about your kingdom work.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nIn Shakespeare’s history play, Richard II, John of Gaunt mourns England’s degradation on his deathbed, intoning, “That England, that was wont to conquer others, Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.” The greatness of England was fading away because of its internal corruption. And this is the truth of all civilizations. They do not fall because of external attack, but they collapse from the corruption and rot festering on the inside.\n\nRepeatedly in Scripture, we also see the children of Israel making a shameful conquest of themselves. There will always be some battle raging, but it’s not a fight against governments and revolutions; the battle is spiritual. The battle is for and in our own hearts. In the New Testament, the apostle Paul arms himself with powerful weapons, urging us to: “Pray at all times in the Spirit, with every prayer and request, and stay alert with all perseverance and intercession for all the saints” (Ephesians 6:18).\n\nCenturies before Paul, Daniel relies on the same principle. The fulfillment of God’s promise to restore the conquered city of Jerusalem and its exiled people was at hand, and Daniel recognized that this providential showering of grace was an opportunity to fix all his hope on God. Israel had fallen to conquest precisely because it had walked in pride and unrepentance. It had rotted from the inside. \n\nDaniel’s prayer is not about self-reliance, or newfound worthiness to return to their homeland. He recognizes that righteousness belongs to God alone (Daniel 9:7). His grace alone, His provision alone is sufficient. He alone can root out the inward-rottenness and make us a new creation, a new nation, and a royal priesthood for Himself.\n\nDaniel prayed: “We are not presenting our petitions before you based on our righteous acts, but based on your abundant compassion. Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, listen and act! My God, for your own sake, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your name” (Daniel 9:18–19).\n\nLike Daniel, our focus must be on our continual need of God’s provision. He must lay conquest to our hearts, that we may not be given over to self-destruction. He alone is righteous and able to save (Daniel 9:7). And, like Daniel, we have this great comfort: He does save. He hears the cries of His people, and restores the inheritance of His saints. He does not leave us as orphans and exiles (John 14:18), but in His own righteousness, He mightily saves.\n\nThe restoration of Jerusalem was a foreshadowing of the restoration of Christ, who has made a glorious conquest of the human heart. He has conquered our hearts, and become our confidence, hope, joy, and strength are founded upon the unchanging and transforming righteousness of God.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Elaine Phillips\n\nReality: “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this darkness, against evil, spiritual forces in the heavens” (Ephesians 6:12). \n\nReally? \n\nHow easily we find ourselves thinking that Twitter feeds, mindless sound bites, even whole paragraphs about presidents, protestors, politics, and pandemics are the substance of our realities. Turns out the apostle Paul did not think of reality so superficially. Neither did Daniel. \n\nLooking back 2500 years ago, international politics were dicey then too. The super power had shifted from Babylon to Persia practically overnight. There seem to have been crises at the top; the alternating names Darius the Mede and Cyrus leave a whiff of uncertainty, not just for puzzled commentators but possibly for real people at that time. \n\nDaniel was a venerable statesman—probably in his eighties at this point—when he chose to fast, humble himself, and seek greater understanding of the rapidly changing circumstances surrounding him (Daniel 10:2–3,12). He commenced these disciplines just prior to the festival of Passover, three years into the Persian rule. Perhaps he anticipated an immediate response in time to celebrate the Passover traditions of redemption from bondage. His previous prayer experience might have led him to expect it. Directly after the Persian takeover, he had prayed earnestly, and the angel Gabriel arrived in swift flight with an answer, even while Daniel was still praying (chapter 9). \n\nThis time was different. Three long weeks passed before the response came. In the meantime, Daniel likely did not eat the Passover meal or drink the cups of wine. When the vision did come, it was overwhelming. Daniel fell to his face before the linen-clad figure, who was wearing a sash of gold, had flaming eyes, a face like lightning, and a thunderous voice (note Revelation 1:13–15). \n\nThe messenger spoke of warring dark powers in the heavens, reaching their tentacles into every earthly turmoil. Evil and sinister “princes” underlay the destructive kingdoms of the Persians and Greeks, both of whom would oppress God’s people severely. The future trauma detailed in chapter 11 would occur more than two centuries after Daniel’s lifetime. Nevertheless, Daniel’s revelation here made it clear these tumultuous events were not outside God’s sovereign plan (Daniel 4:34).\n\nBack to our present: the brutal evil we see daily is an imprint of cosmic war; it requires vigilance and powerful prayer intervention. Hence, Paul’s admonition to put on the full armor of God and to stand, stand, stand firm. Daniel, a ”treasured” person, heard the same admonition: stand and be strong (Daniel 10:11,19). \n\nHow do we stand strong when lies incessantly rage and evil powers rear their ugly heads? “Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10) takes on another dimension, doesn’t it? We must stand against everything false and contrary to the knowledge of God, taking every thought captive to Christ (2Corinthians 10:3–5), ordering our lives by God’s truth, and praying faithfully that the burning arrows of the evil one will be extinguished.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nMy daughters were in Narnia for the first time this summer. Every night, they’d beg for the next chapter of C.S. Lewis’s beloved fantasy series. The spell has taken them in, totally, as we talk of Aslan and Lucy, of Reepicheep and Mr. Tumnus, of glory and dust, of past and future. Prince Caspian is the second book in the series, and its opening chapters read like a stop-and-start, future-and-past prophecy. The Pevensie children return to Narnia, and find themselves retracing their Narnian steps 1300 years after they left, though it has only been a year at home in England. Caspian, the titular character, knew the legends but never expected to find Peter and Susan and Edmund and Lucy and Aslan to come to his aid, restoring his place as rightful king.\n\nAs they struggle to grasp the reality of waking up in the ancient ruins of their once-glorious Cair Paravel, time shifts forward and backward in their minds. Could this be my sword? Peter wonders. Our table? Our home? Is this where we danced and played and ruled a beautiful, peaceful kingdom?\n\nHolding the tension of “the already and not yet,” the mix of grief with memory but also hope, is a benchmark of the Christian life, and I felt that familiar, yet somehow distant, feeling while reading Daniel’s third prophecy, in Daniel 11. Already living in exile, Daniel is given a prophecy of an even longer exile, while also clinging to the hope of the Davidic kingdom the Israelites had once known, longing for the time when they would finally leave exile and rebuild Jerusalem.\n\nDaniel’s prophecies were very real to his audience and to the Jewish people. They predicted events that would be fulfilled over the next four hundred years of Israel’s history—redemption that would come for a season and a people. But the redemption Daniel foresaw comes to us as well. We cling to the hope of something that was here once (Eden), and we know will one day come again (God’s fully restored kingdom). \n\nDaniel’s prophecies, especially here, are for us, too, as people of God’s already-and-not-yet kingdom. As believers with a future hope, we constantly experience the push and pull of kingdom living. Our hearts quicken to signs and wonders, reminding us of something that hasn’t happened yet, but we somehow miss and long for anyway. We are Prince Caspian, steeped in the ancient history of our beloved kingdom, but never expecting the good king himself to break into our present. \n\nBut when he does, it’s glorious. And that hope that Daniel prophesies and the rest of Scripture proclaims, is very real. God’s kingdom is everlasting, from generation to generation. Once, hundreds of years after Daniel’s exile, Jesus broke into the earthly realm and planted the seeds of God’s kingdom. And one day, He will come again, and bring with Him the full flourishing kingdom that our hearts were made to hope for.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Patti Sauls\n\nScripture Reading: Daniel 12:1-13, 2 Peter 3:8-13, Revelation 1:4-8\n\n“How long, LORD? Will you forget me forever?” (Psalm 13:1). When I’m struggling, these words from the psalmist often echo in my mind. I was 15 years old when I learned about Jesus, began reading the Bible, and became a Christian. Now I look back on over thirty years of following God and finding Him faithful. Yet when I trudge through deep valleys of anxiety, conflict, or brokenness, I still often find myself doubting, wondering, Lord, do you see me? Do you care?\n\nDaniel’s visions were terrifying, and the suffering he saw was ongoing and global. He was given a weighty responsibility to witness and report such intense distress. Yet he was also given a powerful reminder of God’s promises. This gracious reminder is for us as well.\n\nAn angelic interpreter explained to Daniel, “Those who have insight will shine like the bright expanse of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever” (Daniel 12:3). What a strange thing to say, that God’s people would shine like stars. But the imagery was not lost on Daniel. He was a faithful Israelite, and this “star talk” would trigger the memory of God’s ancient promise made in the midst of another man’s vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield… Look at the sky and count the stars, if you are able to count them…. Your offspring will be that numerous” (Genesis 15:1,5).  God promised to grow and protect a vast nation through Abram’s family tree. Yet, as the years went by and his wife, Sarai, bore no children, Abram began to fear that God might not be true to His Word.\n\nLike Abram, Daniel was scared of the future. When would the distress give way to deliverance? “How long until the end of these wondrous things?” asked another witness in the vision (Daniel 12:6). Daniel didn’t get all the answers, but he did receive assurance that God was, and would always be, trustworthy. In remembering the stars, Daniel knew that God had not forgotten Abram. A son, Isaac, was born. God kept His promise to grow the nation of Israel through Abram’s descendants, and He changed Abram’s name to Abraham, meaning “Father of a Multitude” (Genesis 17:5). God proved Himself true to Abraham, and He would continue to be faithful to Daniel and all future believers.\n\nMaybe the stars can trigger our memory of God’s faithfulness too. God knows we can be confused by the world’s suffering and by our own pain. Like Daniel, we may be scared of the future. But God assures us He is “the Alpha and the Omega… the one who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty” (Revelation 1:8).\n\nThis is our trustworthy, unchanging, eternal hope. God established His people through Abraham’s son, and He protects and secures His people through His own Son, Jesus. God is with us: we are His people, and He is our God. We may forget God, but He does not forget us. He sees us, and He cares for us. Remember the stars.\n\nPatti Sauls lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband Scott and daughters, Abby and Ellie, where they serve alongside the people of Christ Presbyterian Church.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Patti Sauls\n\nOne tomato. I had grand plans for our backyard garden, but all I got to show for hours of watering and weeding was one, tiny, red tomato. I wish I could wax eloquent about the satisfaction of eating the fruit of my labors. (Fun fact: Tomatoes are botanically classified as fruit.) Instead, my lone tomato humbled me as I admitted that my efforts weren’t enough to produce abundant fruit. \n\nToday’s reading reveals garden rhythms as well. On the night before He was arrested, Jesus said to His disciples, “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener” (John 15:1). Jesus comforted His friends by reminding them that God vigilantly tends to all of His creation. \n\nJesus’s encouragement continued as He described branches, which grew from the vine and produced fruit. These branches, representing His followers, would be healthy and fruitful as long as they were connected to the vine. “Remain in me, and I in you. Just as a branch is unable to produce fruit by itself unless it remains on the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me” (John 15:4).\n\nThe apostle Paul further described this spiritual fruit, explaining that “the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control” (Galatians 5:22–23). These qualities shine collectively like the facets of a sparkling diamond. Together, they illuminate a Christian’s growing inner posture of dependence and obedience toward God, as well as her outer impact on the people and world around her. To this nourishing fruit I say, “Yes, please!”\n\nBut how do we produce such fruit? Do I summon my will power and attempt to weed out my sinful nature that so quickly yields hate, jealousy, selfishness, and worse? (Galatians 5:19–21). I may try, but as soon as I pull up one ugly weed, others sprout up in its place. This scramble ends with the same result as my backyard garden—little fruit and lots of awareness of my inability to produce it.\n\nAre we sentenced to fruitless despair? No, we are given a resource that Jesus announces and seals with a promise: “I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Counselor to be with you forever” (John 14:16). What deep relief! God doesn’t intend for us to muster up spiritual growth on our own. Instead, the Holy Spirit is poured out on us to work in us. \n\nAlthough we are dependent on the Spirit to produce fruit, we are not passive. As a sunflower turns its head to seek out the sun, so we can orient our lives toward God through prayer, Bible study, repentance, praise, and other habits. As Paul said, “If we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:25). We are free to put one foot in front of the other, confidently seeking faithful obedience while resting and remaining in the promise that God fuels our movement by His Spirit at work in and through us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jen Yokel\n\nOf all the aspects of the fruit of the Spirit, love feels like the most universal and, somehow, the most elusive. If you’ve ever tried to explain what it’s like, you know what I mean. Love can feel like analyzing every word of every conversation between meeting someone and confessing your feelings. It can feel like the comfortable silence of deep friendship. It can feel like filling your Instagram feed with pictures of a new baby, or late-night scrolling through photographic memories of a faraway friend. We write songs about it, cry while watching movies that try to portray it, maybe even try to deny it, declaring it a lie when our hearts are broken. \n\nBut Scripture tells us that the true definition of love is found in who God is. In fact, it’s one of the surest things we can know about God, a virtue greater than even faith and hope (1Corinthians 13:13). Scripture tells us “God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him” (1John 4:16). \n\nThe famous “love chapter” of 1 Corinthians 13 outlines many attributes of this love: patience, kindness, not insisting on its own way, rejoicing in truth, hoping and enduring everything. Enduring wars and disease and hatred. Outlasting empires and buildings and movements. In this litany of love’s attributes, I see the face of God. I hear God’s invitation to make ourselves at home in this love and let it transform us through the indwelling Holy Spirit.\n\nThis sort of love is nonsensical, if you think about it. It isn’t a vague, obligatory love for people who are like you, and it goes beyond the bonds of family, friends, or spouse. This love extends the circle wider and wider, transcending rational thought about who is worthy of love; it persists no matter what and in any circumstance, without condition.\n\nThe apostle Paul said, “The whole law is fulfilled in one statement: Love your neighbor as yourself” (Galatians 5:14). What could that look like today, as we imitate Christ to seek the welfare of our neighbors? When we make ourselves at home in God’s transformative love, we are changed. We are empowered to join God in repairing the world, to press on and show our neighbors what we value and to whom we belong.\n\n“You were called to be free, brothers and sisters; only don’t use this freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but serve one another through love” (Galatians 5:13). May it be so in us, the Holy Spirit growing love in our hearts for the flourishing of our families, our neighbors, and all of creation.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Joy",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey T. Hurley\n\nBackstage, before any school music theater performance, our teacher would remind us: “Put on your Disney face!” The “Disney face” was a term meant to encourage happy, bright faces. We were to hold an extra twinkle in our eye, plaster on the largest smile, and over exaggerate each movement while we were on stage, to look as happy and as animated as a Disney character. But it was a façade. It was acting. Our smiles cracked around the edges, and the stage makeup smeared under the hot, heavy lights. The portrayed happiness was left onstage, a fleeting moment and not a reflection of the pain and problems of life off stage. Because in a high school musical, the story tends to end with a “happily ever after.” \n\nWhen I think of a Christian’s joy, I often think the world sees it as a fake, plastered-on type of joy. They believe we either ignore the real pain around us, choosing to remain ignorant of it, or we “fake it ‘til we make it.” After all, how could we possibly have genuine joy when everyone knows life is difficult and hard?\n\nBut “Disney face” happiness is not the true joy the Bible talks about. Biblical joy is not dependent on circumstances, nor is it something we have to force ourselves to feel. Our source of joy doesn’t come from ourselves; it is sourced by God who fills us “with all joy and peace” as we trust in Him and allow the Holy Spirit to help us through the trials and pain of life (Romans 15:13). \n\nTo see me in real life, it might be easy to assume I’m a joyful person, and many would find it difficult to grasp that I struggle with depression and anxiety. These symptoms pop up out of nowhere, and they can make me feel out of control, unable to pull myself out of the grief and fear that I experience. Yet, despite my personal dark seasons, there is an underlying presence of joy that continues. It is the Holy Spirit who holds the grief and the joy together and allows both to exist at the same time.\n\nEven though I may feel afflicted, I am not crushed. When I feel struck down by circumstances, I am not destroyed (2Corinthians 4:8–9). The power of Jesus to overcome sin, darkness, and pain gives me a source for joy. I can delight in a God who is not only sovereign over my life, but is also loving and slow to anger, compassionate and gracious (Exodus 34:6). And when things are tough, beyond my own ability to find a glimmer of joy, I am met in the midst of my pain. In His presence there is “abundant joy” (Psalm 16:11). \n\nSo, despite how others may perceive our joy, we have confidence that joy is rooted in something more than a smile on our face. It is a gift from the Holy Spirit, an everlasting hope. And as we walk with the Spirit, we are filled “with inexpressible and glorious joy” (1Peter 1:8). \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nWhen I think about peace, I imagine three different things. First, I think of the wrap-around porch at my favorite bed and breakfast on Pawleys Island, South Carolina, where we like to vacation in the summer. It looks out over a marsh, where pelicans dive for fish and the sun paints the grasses yellow and then green. Second, I think of my friend Andi, a woman who imparts wisdom with every word she speaks, whose calm tone pervades every syllable. And finally, I think of the moment when my body sinks into a hot bath. The knowledge that I can sit undisturbed for 20 or 30 minutes is as soothing as the steam.\n\nBut our good God tells us that peace is not about a vacation. It’s not about trying to imitate a soft tone of voice, which while authentic to my friend Andi, would be disingenuous if I put it on for size. And it is not about finding more time for self-care, which brings only temporary relief. He knows that the world outside—and the world inside my own mind—is full of strife. But when Christ came, He promised to give His disciples PEACE, not as a means of escape, but as a means to exist and thrive without fear in the midst of the chaos of our world.\n\nAccording to the scriptures, peace is one aspect of the fruit of the Holy Spirit, something that God the Great Gardener will grow in our hearts and lives if we entrust ourselves to His care, no matter our circumstances. Peace will look different in different people’s lives. In the same way that hydrangeas bloom in different colors in different places, depending on the pH of the soil, peace will arrive in our hearts, blooming in its own way, in its own time. One thing is certain: if God promises to give it, then we will certainly receive it. \n\nIn John 14, Jesus says that peace is something He gives away, freely and without cost—not as the world might try to offer it (John 14:27). In Romans, the apostle Paul encourages believers to remember that “we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). And in his letter to the Philippians, he says “the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding” is able to guard our hearts and minds (Philippians 4:6–7). \n\nIn the end, our confidence comes not in our own ability to create peace, but in our relationship with the God of the universe who loves us and provides peace in abundance, simply as an act of His great love. Christ is a means of reconciling all people together in unity, no matter the earthly divisions that try to breed hostility between us (Ephesians 2:11–22). God’s peace is not theoretical. It is real. My circumstances might be in total disarray. Vacations and plans might be canceled. Factions might rise up against each other with weapons or words. In the midst of it all, our eternity is settled, our hearts can rest at ease, knowing that God is our peace.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nMy youngest daughter turns three next month. She is at the delightfully frustrating age where she wants to do far more than she is physically or emotionally able to do, and usually, that means I spend a lot of time waiting for her to “do it all by my OWN!” (Her adorable way of saying “myself.”) \n\nWe love to go on walks as a family in the evenings. My eldest flies down the sidewalk on her bike with training wheels, but my youngest isn’t very speedy. Nor does she try particularly hard to go fast on her scooter or her balance bike. More often that not, my husband and I trade off for the very arduous, slow task of pushing her, drenched with summer sweat, watching the other spouse laughing and jogging in the distance. No manner of coaxing, teaching, encouraging, or letting her go on hills will motivate her to do it herself. So a few weeks ago, I bought her a tricycle. I thought, Surely this will solve our nightly struggle! But dear reader, it did not. Now we just take turns pushing her princess-adorned tricycle up and down the hill.\n\nThere is no fast track for learning to ride a bike, but boy, has it ever tested my patience almost every night this past summer, along with nearly everything else about this almost-comically-catastrophic year. My patience ran out on day two of quarantine, and that was over eight months ago. Have we ever, collectively, felt so impatient, so restless, so tired of non-progress? I’m impatient for the past and the future at the same time. I reason, If we can’t go back to where we were, maybe we could at least hurry up and get to where we’re going! \n\nThis, my friends, is the same tension we feel spiritually. Our impatience for all things to be made new through the restoring, perfecting power of Jesus lingers every day. We long for it to be here soon—Maranatha! Come, Lord! The prophet describes this very longing, set in the hearts of all who believe (Isaiah 30:18–26). And yet, there is a difference between patience from the Spirit (waiting for God’s kingdom to reign forever!) and sinful impatience. \n\nSinful impatience says, “I know what’s right and exactly what I need, and I’m mad I’m not getting it right now.” Patience says, “I trust the Lord and His promises.” Scripture leads us to the same conclusion: a proud spirit is bound up in impatience (Ecclesiastes 7:8). Patience is grown from trust in the Lord and His timing, convinced He knows what we really need, in every realm and facet of our lives. \n\nI believe my daughter will learn to ride a bike. I believe Jesus will return. There are a lot of things I believe I need or want to be happy, but ultimately, my attitude is more often than not one of prideful impatience. It’s impatience born out of my desire to be in control. What the Holy Spirit provides through ongoing sanctification is true patience. I trust Him with my eternity; I need to better trust Him with each day. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Abby Flynn\n\nI grew up in the Midwest, but headed South after college in search of career opportunities and warmer weather. I eventually wound up in the Bible Belt, where I was swiftly initiated into the world of Southern charm. At first, I was shocked by how kind everyone was! But as the weeks and months in my new city went on, I realized not all of the “Bless your hearts,” were actual blessings. And most of the passing “We should get together sometime” farewells weren’t really future social invitations. It seemed that some Southern charm was actually just a cover-up for awkward situations. It was a way to seem like a nice person without ever actually having to do anything nice. Now granted, I still live in the South and have grown to love it. But I have to be watchful, even in my own life, of not mistaking being “nice” for genuine kindness.\n\nIn contrast, today’s reading reminds us of what real, Holy Spirit kindness looks like. And it’s about a whole lot more than just donating to charities and holding the door open for the person behind you. When we fully understand and begin to emulate real, Christ-like kindness, it will affect every aspect of our lives.\n\nTitus 3 shows us that God’s love and kindness are not just genuine—they have a purpose: to lead us back to Him! (Titus 3:4–7). So when kindness is evident in our treatment of others, we, in turn, are pointing them toward God. Because “when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us—not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to his mercy—through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit” (vv.4–5).\n\nAs followers of Jesus, we’re called to show graciousness and mercy to everyone, even our enemies. Yes, that even means the people we disagree with on Facebook, and the ones who have nothing to offer us in return (Luke 6:34–35). You see, kindness is at the heart of the gospel. We are all sinners and imperfect people who have been radically forgiven. There is nothing we could do to earn the love and mercy of the Lord, and yet He gives it to us freely. That’s kindness that we cannot begin to understand.\n\nSo as Christians, what does the Spirit producing kindness in us look like in everyday life? Maybe it’s the Lord making you a light in the world, offering hope to your coworkers or family. Or perhaps, it’s practicing graciousness in the middle of a difficult situation. Kindness might look like extending mercy to someone who has hurt you, whether they deserve it or not. Our kindness will play a huge part in our testimony, if only we will allow God to use it. But make no mistake, however kindness is exemplified in our lives, it is grown and cultivated by the Holy Spirit, a mark of His own kindness toward us.\n\nLord, open our eyes to see others as you see them: fellow image-bearers of our Creator. Make us instruments of your kindness and reflections of your mercy, even now.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Scarlet Hiltibidal\n\nOn my first date with my husband, we sat in his bright blue Honda hatchback in the church parking lot and he asked me a question. \n\n“What’s your favorite book of the Bible?”\n\nHis question was jarring since I’d been solely fixated on making sure the white eyelet babydoll-cut tunic top I’d worn for our date was hanging in the most flattering way possible. I hadn’t rehearsed a “favorite book of the Bible” speech, but I’d been a Christian-school-Baptist-church kid long enough to have an answer.\n\n“James,” I said.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because it’s really clear and it tells me what to do.”\n\nSomehow I found comfort in the clarity of James because I was still young enough to think I could be perfect, what with the book’s directives to consider suffering to be amazing, or the whole if you can’t control your tongue, your faith is false (James 1). I mean, I knew I’d messed up in the past, but with the start of a new day, I could start over at trying to be perfect, right? Or maybe even starting now—well, maybe not right-this-second now, but NOW, as in starting tomorrow. God would surely accept my goodness if it were fully and perfectly good starting tomorrow, right?\n\nThe words of James are holy and beautiful and true, but I was misunderstanding them because I was completely fixated on my goodness. I thought James was telling me to strive for joy in suffering and a perfectly controlled tongue and actions that perfectly lined up with every command in the Bible. I didn’t yet understand that having a relationship with Jesus would naturally produce the goodness James spoke about. I didn’t understand that the goodness I was to be pursuing was the goodness of God, fruit of the Holy Spirit, not the “goodness” of Scarlet.\n\nPsalm 31 declares, “How great is your goodness”—meaning God’s goodness (Psalm 31:19). If we’re aiming to bear fruit and striving to be thought of as good for the sake of our own identity, not only are we doing it wrong, but we will never get it right. God is good. We are broken. Pursuing goodness in our own strength also means pursuing heartbreak, failure, hopelessness, and even idolatry.\n\nBut if we pursue joy in the Lord, if we look at His goodness and remember the ways He is good to us—His power over death and ability to forgive us, and His promise to love us unfailingly—we can be people marked by His fruit. Not fruit that says, “Come see how good I look in my white eyelet shirt and with my awesome knowledge of the book of James!” But fruit that whispers that I am “radiant with joy because of the LORD’S goodness” (Jeremiah 31:12).\n\nBeauty, goodness, and joy pour out of us when, and only when, we are enraptured by and grateful for the goodness of the Lord. And in my limited experience, the more time I spend seeing and enjoying Him in the pages of the Bible, the more clearly I see that He is, just as our hearts hope, so very good.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Faithfulness",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Alena Pitts\n\nGod is faithful. \n\nAbout two years ago, I would have called God anything but faithful. I had just lost my mom and my world was turned completely upside down. God didn’t seem far. He actually felt nonexistent. “He is faithful. He is faithful. He is faithful,” I would forcefully utter to myself, barely believing it, whispering it, down on my knees. As a 14-year-old dealing with the gravity of not having a mom, the words “He is faithful” did not naturally spill off of my tongue. But I continued to utter those words, praying that they would one day become real to me.\n\nTrusting His faithfulness is one of the hardest things to believe about the Father. As humans who can’t see the full picture, we assume God has just stopped drawing it. When we can’t clearly see, hear, or feel Him, we assume He is not present. We believe He has left us. \n\nI, for one, am grateful that this isn’t just a 21st-century feeling. Throughout the Bible, we watch God’s people doubt His faithfulness time and time again. Sarah doubted that God would fulfill His promise of giving her a child (Genesis 18:10–15). The Israelites felt abandoned and lived in disbelief about God bringing them out of Egypt and into a future in the promised land (Exodus 16:1–12; 17:1–7). And throughout the psalms, David continues to ask God why He has left him (see Psalm 22). \n\nThank God that we see their pictures and stories fully drawn out. Sarah did receive her promised son (Genesis 21:1–7), the Israelites made it into the promised land (Joshua 21:43–45), and God rescued David again and again (see Psalm 30). It turns out He is still working, even when He seems silent. Here’s the best news: God doesn’t remove His promises from us when we doubt. He is compassionate, patient, and understanding (Exodus 34:6–7). What a humbling thought! \n\nLooking back now at the last two years of my life, I have experienced God’s faithfulness in an entirely new way. I didn’t see it then, but years later I clearly see His hand at work. Deuteronomy 7:9 says, “Know that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps His gracious covenant loyalty for a thousand generations with those who love him and keep his commands.”\n\nYes, God is faithful. His Word is true. And if we belong to Him, He makes us more like Him (1John 1:5–7). The Holy Spirit displays this faithfulness in and through us, which helps us to be faithful to God and to others (Luke 6:43–45).\n\nMy prayer for you is that our faithful, promise-keeping God would reveal Himself to you. That you would look back one month, five months, or a few years from now, and clearly see His hand on the canvas of your life. He is faithful, and by His Spirit, we grow in faithfulness.\n\nSixteen-year-old author, vocalist, and actress, Alena Pitts, recently made her professional acting debut in the 2015 film, War Room—the 6th-highest grossing Christian film in box-office history. She has since co-authored the three-book fictional series, Lena in the Spotlight, with her mother, Wynter Pitts, author and founder of For Girls Like You Ministries. Tragically, Alena’s mother passed from death to life on July 24th, 2018. While the loss has left them heartbroken, her family continues to tell Wynter’s story as an opportunity to share the hope they have found in Jesus Christ. Alena and her family reside in Franklin, Tennessee. \n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nIn an instant, the whole world seemed to fall away. We had just been told that our unborn child had serious and life-threatening medical issues. The doctor delivering the news was clinical…cold…indifferent. To her, this was just another baby who might not make it. To us, it was a category five hurricane of fear, stress, and pain. \n\nAs the doctor rattled off our options (none of them good), my heart started to race and my palms became sweaty. I was having trouble comprehending the information. I fought simultaneous urges to either bolt from the room and melt into the exam table. Then came the hand…\n\nThe ultrasound tech sitting beside me reached out his hand and held mine. He didn’t say a word. His gift to me was a soft touch. It was a simple, sweet gesture loaded with power. His gentleness put an oxygen mask on my heart. I could breathe again. I could think again. I could face my new reality. All because a stranger tenderly reached toward me. \n\nEncounters with true gentleness are rare. As broken people in a broken world, this is not our way, not our natural inclination. As I reflect on how I interact with others most often it’s clear: if life is a china shop, then I am a bull. In my flesh, I barrel my way through conversations, I crash through conflicts, I careen through daily life. Jesus reaches toward us with a different way, though—the way of gentleness. \n\nThe book of Isaiah records the prophet’s description of God’s power (Isaiah 40:10). But then Isaiah seems to make a hard right:\n\nHe tends his flock like a shepherd:He gathers the lambs in his armsand carries them close to his heart;he gently leads those that have young (Isaiah 40:11, NIV).\n\nGod doesn’t have mood swings. He isn’t one or the other—He is both. He is unmatched in both power and gentleness (Matthew 11:29). He commands heaven’s armies (Psalm 46:7) and tenderly leads His flock. He is the roaring lion of Judah and our precious Passover Lamb. All of this points to His power, which is strong enough to destroy sin and death and gentle enough to woo us toward Him with His grace. \n\nAs God’s children, the Spirit teaches us to live in this remarkable tension. We don’t have to clamor for attention, for influence, for power. Our lives can gently whisper about God’s goodness. And the world who is in the eye of the hurricane of sin and darkness will listen. God’s gentleness, extended through us, is so shocking it warrants attention. Jesus, in His mercy, has reached His gentle hand toward us. May the power of His Spirit help us reach out in gentleness toward others. \n\nLord, thank you for being our powerfully gentle Savior. Teach us to be more like you. Amen.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Self-Control",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nBefore the kids woke up yesterday, I read 1 Corinthians 9 aloud to my husband over coffee. We don’t always read Scripture out loud to each other in the mornings. Often, mornings are all about the baby, and the puppy, and the breakfast preferences of the children. (Who hates blackberries? Have you eaten anything other than peanut butter this week?) But when I do read Scripture in the morning, I always end up reading it out loud—because it gets me so emphatically stirred up.\n\nWithin this passage, I took a startled pause at verse 27: “I discipline my body and bring it under strict control, so that after preaching to others, I myself will not be disqualified” (1Corinthians 9:27). I shouted to my husband, “Now, that’s not the gospel I know!” He looked at me in alarm because the children were absolutely still sleeping, and said, “I think Paul is talking about his qualifications as an effective minister.” \n\nThe gospel that I know is one of grace and faith, not a gospel of works. The “work” is already done by Christ’s sacrifice, death, and resurrection. There is nothing I can do to make God love me one iota more or one tick less. Hallelujah! Full stop. So how dare Paul talk about disqualification? And his reference to the physical training of the body, makes my sweet, soft, motherly self feel even more uncomfortable. I know that the gates of heaven don’t require me to qualify by running a mile in four minutes. But what does Paul mean? Because I’d like to skip over this bit and get back to the part where God is comforting me and telling me not to be afraid.\n\nBut Augustine of Hippo said, “If you believe what you like in the Gospel, and reject what you don’t like, it is not the Gospel you believe, but yourself.” Okay, right. Noted. Those are dark, deep, waters in which I do not wish to swim.  \n\nSo what is the role and value of self-control in the life of the believer? It is not the grounds of salvation, but it is the outpouring of a sanctified heart. “Now everyone who competes exercises self-control in everything. They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we have an imperishable crown” (1Corinthians 9:25). The self-control of athletes is laudable. So the Holy Spirit equips us to exercise self-control in our minds and hearts minute to minute as we encounter our days. This self-control is the practical outworking of genuine faith. We run as if to win, because we value the great salvation we already have in Christ—He has already won it for us.\n\nWe all know exactly where we can show more self-control: show more restraint, be less controlled by emotions, etc. But it’s probably personal and different for each of us. But I do not have the strength and self-control to pull myself together. If my resolve were strong enough to give up sugar and be a perfect parent, I would have already done it. But our self-control, our qualifications, and our strength come from walking in step with the Spirit. As we walk, our hearts will be changed and the courage and strength to exercise control over our weak and fragile minds and bodies will grow. Walk with the Spirit. Run to Christ and He will make you whole.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Our Ever-Present God",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jessica Lamb\n\nGod is not only universally present above and beyond creation; He is also personally present, dwelling with His people.\n\nSometimes, I’m afraid to acknowledge the nearness of God. I’m afraid of what I’ll hear, or what uncomfortable truths I’ll have to face about who I am, because to encounter God’s presence means to be made more and more like Him (2Corinthians 3:18). So I ignore the reality of His persistent, relational presence, and instead turn to distraction: working more, endlessly scrolling through social media, blasting my favorite podcast, or binge-watching a television show—anything to numb my heart and mind.\n\nBut to live this way is to miss out on really knowing Him, to miss the opportunity to join the psalmist in proclaiming the gift of God’s presence: “As for me, God’s presence is my good. I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, so I can tell about all you do” (Psalm 73:28).\n\nOnce I started looking for the theme of God’s presence in Scripture, I began to find it on every page. Sure, I’d thought about God’s presence before. I know He is enthroned on high (Psalm 113:4–6). I know He fills the heavens and the earth and that there is nowhere I can go where He doesn’t see me (Psalm 139; Jeremiah 23:24).\n\nBut Scripture has so much more to say about God’s presence. In passage after passage, we’re told that God also desires to be relationally present with His people. Authors and biblical scholars J. Scott Duvall and J. Daniel Hays even suggest that this is the central theme of the entire Bible.\n\nGod heard every time the enslaved Israelites cried out against the injustice they suffered in Egypt (Exodus 3:9), and He showed up in a visible pillar of cloud and fire to lead them on their journey out of captivity (Exodus 13:20–22).\n\nGod is before all things and holds all things together (Colossians 1:17), and He intercedes for me in wordless groans when even I don’t know how or what to pray (Romans 8:26–27).\n\nGod can’t be contained in any house built by human hands (1Kings 8:27; Acts 17:24), yet He walked off the dusty roads of Judea and into the homes of sinners, tax collectors, drunkards, and fisherman to eat and drink with them (Matthew 24:49; Luke 10:38–42; 19:1–10).\n\nAs you’ll discover in this reading plan, we were created for this kind of relationship with God—to live in His presence, experience His goodness, and enjoy Him all the days of our lives. God has always drawn near to His people, and even now, He invites us to draw near to Him.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jen Yokel\n\nOur holy God, through His grace and provision, welcomes imperfect people into His presence.\n\nOver the past few months, I’ve been fascinated by the life and writing of Julian of Norwich. As a 14th century English woman, Julian knew a thing or two about living in a chaotic world. From political turmoil to watching her community’s decimation by the Black Death, she no doubt sensed the fear of her world and heard the pains of her neighbors. I imagine as an anchorite, a woman living out her days secluded in a church yet still available to her community, her neighbors would have come to her. I picture her as a safe, motherly presence where they could confess their fears, vent their anger, and ask for prayer.\n\nYet for all this heaviness, here is a woman who could write these words: “All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well.”\n\nOver 600 years later, it is clear that all is still not well. This story stretches even farther back than the Middle Ages—the story of a people searching for the presence of God.\n\nLike Isaiah, we look upon God’s glory and despair at all we can never be (Isaiah 6:1–7). Like David, we ache to dwell with God and gaze on His beauty (Psalm 27:4). We talk about a Creator who is close to creation, maybe even catch a glimpse of Him in the laughter of loved ones or the roar of the ocean, yet we also read of the throne room in Revelation and wonder how we could survive such astonishing power (Revelation 4).\n\nWhat is this presence we all seek? What does it mean to find God when the world is in disarray and He feels unreachable?\n\nIn his letter to the Ephesians, Paul begins by reminding these faithful Christ-followers who they once were: without Christ, excluded and without hope (Ephesians 2:12). They were Gentiles, outsiders to Israel’s promises and citizenship, yet even that division, as Paul points out, is “done in the flesh by human hands” (v.11). God’s greater plan is a radical, cosmic hospitality, beginning and ending with a very real, human yet divine presence.\n\n“But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ” (Ephesians 2:13). In the mystery of grace, a Rabbi who loved, healed, laughed, wept, listened, and suffered also died and returned to life. He broke down the divisions between Jew and Gentile, slave and free, male and female, God and humanity. And in an even greater mystery, we become the dwelling place of God, each of us adding rooms to a living temple more glorious than the finest building in the world, a shelter from a world of plagues and turmoil and despair.\n\nGod’s presence, His dwelling, is no longer a place “out there” that we have to reach. It’s not an exclusive club or a far-off mountaintop. It is awe-inspiring, maybe even terrifying, and it is as close as skin and bone. It defies our human boundaries and looks like a parade of misfits who are grateful for a seat at the table. It is safety and warmth and family. All are welcome and there is always room for more, always a space to come in from the chaos and rest in the hope that all just might be well.\n\n",

Like clockwork, our first baby, Abby, would get fussy right before bedtime. Cue the footie pajamas, last bottle, diaper change, beloved blankie and a snuggle. I’d hold her close as she wriggled in my arms fighting sleep. Quietly, I would sing the familiar lullaby that my dad had sung over me: “Night, night, oh Abby. Sleepy tight, oh Abby. Close your eyes, oh Abby. Night, night, night, night… night.” Soon, her eyelids would get heavy, her breath would slow and deepen, and her little body would relax as she nestled into my chest.\n\nI wish I could wrap my head and heart around the fact that God holds me tight, that He loves me like this. Do we believe that God embraces us in our weariness? The prophet Isaiah insists that God is not remote or withdrawn. On the contrary, we need not fear because God is with us, He strengthens us, and He upholds us (Isaiah 41:10). Do we believe that God enjoys us and sings over us? Zephaniah 3:17 tells us, “The LORD your God is among you, a warrior who saves. He will rejoice over you with gladness. He will be quiet in his love. He will delight in you with singing.”\n\nGod is a warrior who saves. He fights for me and gives me refuge, strength, and help in times of trouble (Psalm 46:1). But it’s not only His powerful presence that gives me strength. His tender presence strengthens me too. Our God is a lullaby-singing warrior who loves His children.\n\nIsaiah reveals God’s deep tenderness by comparing Him to a shepherd: “He protects his flock like a shepherd; he gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them in the fold of his garment. He gently leads those that are nursing” (Isaiah 40:11). Our minds can’t fully grasp the reality of Almighty God stooping down to care for us in the messy, nitty-gritty of our daily lives. Yet we’re invited to see Him doting on us like a shepherd tending his needy sheep. This is how God has chosen to reveal Himself to us. He doesn’t merely tolerate us; He delights in us. He gathers us up in His arms, carries us close, and sings to us.\n\nYes, God is a fierce warrior fighting for His people and a singing warrior who delights in us and quiets us with His love. In this we find a nourishing strength that satisfies our souls. We can rest in His arms, close our eyes, and slow our breath as He sings over us. Instead of suffering our own pounding hearts, we can lean in and hear His steady heartbeat. It beats steadily with His love for us.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey T. Hurley\n\nWhen we remember God’s presence goes with us and before us, we can find comfort in any circumstance.\n\nWhen we walk through the desert seasons of our lives, anxious and uncertain if we will ever make it to a safe place of rest, will we believe God’s presence goes with us? And will His presence be enough to rescue us from our fears?\n\nIt was 2018 and my husband was out of town when I had my first anxiety attack. I had no idea what was happening to me—why my heart was racing, why I was so faint, why I could not gain composure over my breathing. Feeling totally alone and out of control, I called 911 at 2am. I was hoping the paramedics would come and save me from what felt like a heart attack, only to be given a “sorry” glance as the paramedics packed up and confirmed it was anxiety.\n\nMonths went by and I couldn’t sleep, drive my car, or be away from my two-year-old without having severe anxiety over a possible future anxiety attack. I was emotionally, physically, and spiritually exhausted; I questioned why God allowed this to happen and wondered when He was going to come and deliver me from this ongoing fear and give me His peace instead.\n\nIn Exodus 33, God’s people were in the desert wondering when God was going to deliver them from their circumstances. With the people anxious for answers, Moses pleaded with God to reveal the next step and to promise to go with them as they journeyed to the promised land. Moses knew he was not going to be successful if God’s presence was not with them. He wanted assurance from God that He would be with them despite the future hardships they were sure to encounter.\n\nAnd God answered, “My presence will go with you and I will give you rest” (Exodus 33:14). God didn’t promise a specific day upon which they would finally rest in their future home. He didn’t promise that nothing unpleasant would happen on their journey. Instead, He promised His presence, which is more than enough to give God’s people comfort through any challenging unknowns—a promise we still have today.\n\nI may not know what will trigger a future anxiety attack, but God’s presence goes with me and before me. “I fear no danger, for [He is] with me” and His guiding rod and staff comfort me along the way (Psalm 23:4)—this is a prayer I can pray with confidence knowing God is near.\n\nAs you wrestle with setbacks, fears, difficult circumstances, unexpected bad news, and seemingly unanswered prayers, may you find comfort in God’s presence. His presence will strengthen you to continue to hope and wait on His rest and His peace. “May the Lord of peace himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with all of you” (2Thessalonians 3:16).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kara Gause\n\nAs we focus our hearts and minds on Him, we become more aware of our ever-present God.\n\nSomeone once asked me to picture my ideal eternity: with everyone I love present and accounted for, healthy and satisfied and fulfilled, with all my favorite treats and ways to while away the hours (if such a time constraint exists in heaven). If I could have everything I’ve ever wanted or imagined wanting, but God was not there, would I still be happy? Was my idea of heaven still “heaven” if God was not there?\n\nHuh.\n\nNow, I knew what the “right” answer was—boy, did I—but if I’m really honest, the right answer brought me no comfort or peace and, while I’m ashamed to admit it, no honest-to-goodness joy. The truth is that, when I imagined actually being in the presence of God, in the same room with Him, so to speak, well, I felt a lot more comfortable with one of us being on the other side of the door. You know, we’re aware the other is there, and we’re “good”: I recognized my need for Him, and He went to the cross for me so that we could actually be in the same room together.\n\nForever.\n\nNeedless to say, that one question took me on a journey of really beginning to look for God, to seek out His person, to really know Him. Because if He laid out His life for me, for the joy of having me with Him for eternity (Hebrews 12:2), and yet I somehow still felt the need for separation and physical distance from Him, then that was a problem. I had a sense that He went to the cross for more than just the effort of making us “good” with one another.\n\nI realized that to “seek His face” I would have to seek Him out intimately (1Chronicles 16:11). And when I searched for Him, when I sought Him out with all my heart and all my soul (Deuteronomy 4:29), He showed Himself to be anything but indifferent toward me. Through His Word and by His Spirit and the testimony of His Church (Colossians 3:14–16), He led me to really see the passion that led Him to the cross to die for me: so we could be in the presence of one another unencumbered by my sin, because “the LORD [our] God is a compassionate God” (Deuteronomy 4:31). The reality is that He is always with me because He wants to be. That truth leaves me utterly awestruck, yet somehow, I’m still prone to forget.\n\nSo, are you like me: have you continued to allow your shame to close your heart off from true relationship with Him? Have you believed the lie that the one who died a vicious and humiliating death to save you is somehow indifferent toward you? Take Him at His Word: seek Him, and He’ll remind you of what is true.\n\nIf you have been brought back into God’s presence through the blood of Jesus, then His presence and holiness aren’t meant to cause trembling from a place of fear, but of excitement and anticipation that one day, not so long from now, we won’t have to search for Him because we will get to see Him face to face (1Corinthians 13:12). Until that day, we don’t have to settle for just being “okay” with God—we get to have relationship with Him. We can seek Him out because He wants to be found.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Life with God in the Garden",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitie Stoddard\n\nGod created us to live and serve in His presence, but our sin made us unfit for life in the garden.\n\nRunning barefoot through soft, green grass was a quintessential part of my childhood summers. But when I moved to a desert climate as an adult, I learned that maintaining an inviting yard required a sprinkler system and a green thumb. Having neither, I struggled each summer to keep our landscape from turning dry and brown like the hills that surrounded us.\n\nMy battle with the vegetation each year is a consistent reminder that we are not living in the garden of Eden as God first designed it. Images of the Pacific Northwest, with their misty lakes and dense forests, may seem a little closer to that lush paradise on earth. But in our present state, when we dig beneath the surface, no place, person, or thing is truly perfect or whole anymore.\n\nI’m guessing most of us feel far from Eden. Whether it’s problems in our personal lives, the health of a family member, or devastation abroad, there is no shortage of brokenness here and now. But when we look back to the very beginning of creation, we learn that this suffering is not what God desired for His masterpiece.\n\nWe all know the story. When God made the earth, He “planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he placed the man he had formed” (Genesis 2:8). But we often miss the best part of the garden! It’s not the fertile ground or the naming of the animals, but the fact that God Himself walked among His people, in communion with them. God’s original intention was for men and women to live and serve in His presence.\n\nWhen Adam and Eve chose to sin by disobeying God, choosing their own way over His, the greatest consequence wasn’t pain in childbirth or a lackluster harvest, but separation from God’s presence. And that separation was banishment from Eden, death to the soul, and ultimately death to the body. When God first created the world there was no mention of death or destruction. It was only after humanity chose the way of sin that brokenness entered the scene.\n\nGod could have left it at that. Handing Adam, Eve, and every generation to follow, over to the downfall of our own decisions. But that is not who God is. God is merciful. God is love. And so, God sent His own perfect Son to be the man Adam could not. To live a righteous life, never choosing sin like we do. To be the spotless Lamb, sacrificed to atone for our damage. It was the greatest act of undeserved forgiveness, God giving Himself over to death to save the ones who’d betrayed Him.\n\nGod pays the price for our sin because He longs for complete connection with us once again, to walk in the garden with His creation. I cannot begin to fathom how deep His love is for us. But what I do know is that because of Jesus’s sacrifice we are welcomed back into the presence of God. Even in a land east of Eden, we can live and serve with God through His Holy Spirit. And for all who trust in Him, we will walk with our God in paradise again.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nGod’s presence was with Moses and with Israel as they were brought out of slavery in Egypt.\n\nWhen Moses left Egypt, he had no map, no idea of which way to go, or what awaited him when he arrived. He had the presence of God to guide him, and he hedged his future (and that of the hundreds of thousands of Israelites who went with him) on the voice he heard in the wilderness, who appeared with a sweeping claim of authority and sovereignty:\n\n“This is what you are to say to the Israelites:I AM has sent me to you” (Exodus 3:14).\n\nThis story is a familiar one in Sunday school classes, Hollywood movies, and sermon illustrations. What I love about Scripture and these beloved stories is how many different lenses we can wear to examine them. While we could read this passage through Moses’s eyes, as I usually do, I believe it’s even more compelling to read it through the lens of God’s presence that was with Moses and His people.\n\nBeginning in Exodus 3, God reveals He has come to Moses because of the cries of His people: “Then the LORD said, “I have observed the misery of my people in Egypt, and have heard them crying out because of their oppressors. I know about their sufferings” (v.7).\n\nGod was there in Egypt, with His people. His omnipresence, His everywhere-ness, meant that He never left. And so when He called them out of Egypt to go behind Him into the wilderness, they followed. In Exodus 6, God identified Himself to Moses as the God who had been with his fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. His presence wasn’t new, but it was revealed in a new, personal way to Moses.\n\nGod directed the Israelites’ route, not “along the road toward the land of the Philistines, even though it was nearby” but “around toward the Red Sea” (Exodus 13:17–18). God wasn’t calling them out of oppression and then letting them stumble around, waiting for the stars to direct their steps; rather, He had a specific path for them to follow, one in which He would lead and they would have to learn to trust and follow Him.\n\nHis presence, provision, and promises are everywhere in this story. He was there, constantly providing for His people, whether defeating their enemies, sending manna and quail to nourish them, literally lighting their way, and more. He faithfully kept His promises to Moses.\n\nThis year, with its pandemic, politics, and personal tragedies, feels a little like the wilderness. I don’t know about you, but I would love a good map to show me how to navigate this season. Every road feels like a dead end these days, or maybe more of a roundabout that circles us around and around but never quite spits us out going in the right direction. None of the old paths work, and I’m not sure I want to go where these new paths are taking me.\n\nWhen God called Moses, He didn’t promise him an easy road. In fact, Moses himself never made it to the promised land. But God did promise Himself, His presence, and His perfect provision. He was always there. Today, I need to know that those promises, and God’s unfailing presence, are mine as well.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nLike Moses’s face made radiant by standing in God’s presence on Mt. Sinai, God’s people are transformed by life in His presence.\n\nWhen I read picture books about the garden of Eden to my children, I get asked a lot of questions about all the nakedness. “I can see Adam’s bottom!” my son shouts, knowing a cause for gleeful hilarity when he sees one. So, why were they naked? Genesis tells us there was no need for coverings because they were without shame (Genesis 2:25). In our original created state, our bottoms aren’t hilarious or embarrassing; they are what they are, which is to say, glorious hind ends. But the shame we experience as a result of our sin takes away our freedom. God’s holy and righteous presence can shine a light on our humiliation, but through the power of Christ, He has also taken away our shame and given us freedom from it. The presence of God’s perfect Son transforms us from shameful to glorious.\n\nMoses’s face was made radiant by standing in God’s presence on Mount Sinai. God prepared him, saying, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear when I speak with you and will always believe you” (Exodus 19:9). But the children of Israel did not want to see that nonsense; they were scared and unable to look Moses straight in the face (2 Corinthians 3:7; Exodus 34:30). They needed Moses to cover up the traces of glory lingering around his wrinkled eyes because it made them uncomfortable—it reminded them of their own shame and underscored the huge chasm between their own sin and a perfect, holy God (Exodus 34:33). But Moses had been transformed, and he didn’t even “realize that the skin of his face shone as a result of his speaking with the Lord” (v.29). This transformation is just a foreshadowing of the transformation we now experience through the life, death, and resurrection of Christ.\n\nFor if the ministry that brought condemnation had glory,the ministry that brings righteousness overflows with even more glory.In fact, what had been glorious is not glorious now by comparisonbecause of the glory that surpasses it. For if what was set aside was glorious,what endures will be even more glorious (2 Corinthians 3:8–11).\n\nThe old covenant of the law is only a shadow of our new and finished covenant in Jesus Christ. The glory of His presence is even more gloriously available to us who live in His covenant.\n\nHave you ever felt unable to discipline your children because of your own sin, worried that your own imperfection precludes you from upholding the rules in your own home? Have you ever felt ashamed to stand up for the truth of the gospel because you are ashamed of something you have done in the dark? The transforming power of Christ has set us free. We can leave our sin behind and walk forward with confidence in His presence. We are made free by His presence. Christ lifts the veil! Indeed, “where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom” (2 Corinthians 3:17).\n\nWe are a free people. By all means, wear pants, but walk forward leaving your sin and shame at the foot of Christ’s cross. The presence of the Lord equips us to do His good work without shame and fear. When you walk in His presence, the shame the world tries to pin on you can’t damage you. Let your face shine with His glory.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "God Dwells Among His People in the Tabernacle",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nGod provided a place for His people to draw near to Him.\n\nWe live in the shadowlands.\n\nConsider the tabernacle, that place of awe and wonder described often in the Old Testament. From cherubim stitched into towering curtains to pillars overlaid with gold, the size and beauty of the tabernacle would have taken our breath away. Yet, inside all of that artistry and engineering was something (or Someone) even more spectacular: “They are to make a sanctuary for me so that I may dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8).\n\nSit in that thought for a moment. Let your imagination try to wrap itself around the fact that the God who spoke the stars into being (Isaiah 40:26), the One who sits enthroned above the circle of the earth (v.22), and measures the waters of the earth in the hollow of His hand (v.12), chose to dwell in a tent built by human hands. What could speak to God’s love for us and to His desire to be in relationship with us more than this? But as spectacular as the tabernacle must have been and as breathtaking as it would have been to see the cloud of God’s presence descend (Exodus 40:34), it was only a shadow of a coming, greater reality.\n\nJesus did more than descend in a cloud. He wrapped Himself in human flesh and walked among the people He’d made. Through Jesus, man experienced fellowship with God undivided by poles and curtains. Yet even as we read about the Son of God walking and talking with man in the Gospels, we’re still just seeing shadows. God’s desire to dwell among the Israelites in the portable tabernacle and Christ’s willingness to take on flesh and live among mankind both point forward to the ultimate, full union of God and His people.\n\nJesus Christ is both the High Priest and sacrifice that we need: holy, innocent, undefiled. In order to be with us, He died “once and for all time when he offered himself” (Hebrews 7:27). Our High Priest’s work is finished, and now He sits “down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a minister of the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that was set up by the Lord and not man” (Hebrews 8:1–2).\n\nYes, the earthly tabernacle was eventually destroyed. And Christ’s human body became His glorified body before He ascended to the right hand of the Father, but those long shadows trace back and extend forward into a time when “night will be no more; people will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God will give them light, and they will reign forever and ever” (Revelation 22:5). Everything we experience here on earth is merely a shadow of the greater, redeemed reality that is to come in the new heavens and the new earth. We can endure life in the shadows because we know a day is coming when we will fully dwell with Him, and He with us, forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Melanie Rainer\n\nGod’s presence filled the temple, and His people drew near and worshiped Him.\n\nMy church has been going through a study of the psalms of ascent (Psalms 120–134), fifteen psalms tucked toward the back of the book that chronicle the journey the Israelites made to Jerusalem to worship God in the temple. Each week, as we study another, I feel each step of the journey anew, inextricably linked in this year with the long separation from public worship earlier this year. The psalmist says, “I rejoiced with those who said to me, “Let’s go to the house of the Lord” (Psalm 122:1). His longing echoes my own to worship and be near God in His house. It’s a theme that permeates the psalms of ascent, and my heart today.\n\nBut why?\n\nWhy did the temple mean so much to the Israelites, that together they would sing as they walked up its steps? Why did it hurt with every beat of their collective heart when the temple was destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 BC? Why was building a second temple on the foundations of the first so important to the Jewish people when they returned to Jerusalem from exile? (Ezra 1).\n\nWhy? Because God’s presence came and dwelt there.\n\nIn 1 Kings 8, the elders of Israel bring the ark of the covenant to rest in the inner sanctuary of the newly finished temple. The ark of the covenant symbolized the Lord’s ongoing presence with the Israelites (Numbers 7:89). Since their days with Moses at Mount Sinai, the ark had been on the move. Now, it was brought into a permanent structure—the temple. Once it came to rest in the most holy place, “the glory of the LORD filled the temple” (1Kings 8:11).\n\nKing Solomon then offers a prayer of dedication that is one of the most beautiful speeches in all of Scripture. It’s a visceral prayer that must have echoed through the meticulously-planned walls of the temple. On and on Solomon goes, listing and describing the many times and ways and places the people would come to commune with their holy God in His temple (vv.31–42). The temple was different, and Solomon’s prayer punches through scenario after scenario of when the people could come into God’s presence via the representative priests who could enter the most holy place. The temple was a reminder that God was dwelling among His people. And yet, it was still separated by a curtain into the holy of holies, where only the high priest could enter once a year.\n\nThat is, until Jesus came as the physical presence of God on earth. And when He ascended into heaven, the Holy Spirit came to commune with God’s people, to guide them and be present with them. And one day, when Jesus comes again and believers live with Him in the new Jerusalem, God will be present with no curtains, no barriers, no fear, and no death.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Erin Davis\n\nWhen God’s people turned away from Him, He removed His presence from the temple.\n\nThough the pages of Scripture contain many tragedies, the ones that stop my heart involve the loss of God’s presence. I think of Mary, who carried her Savior inside her womb, who studied the curve of His profile daily, who watched Him as He performed miracles. Then I try to imagine her at the foot of the cross. How could she find the strength to keep breathing when she pictured a future without Him near?\n\nI think of the disciples, who’d physically walked and talked with Jesus, and then had to wrap their minds around the fact that His body now lay lifeless in a tomb, shrouded in darkness. After they’d journeyed beside Jesus, how could they take a single step without Him?\n\nAnd I think of the Israelites, who experienced God’s presence as a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (Exodus 13:21), then stared with wide-eyed wonder as His glory filled the temple (1Kings 8:11).\n\nImagine the gut punch of hearing God’s righteous judgment on the sins of His people: “Has this house, which bears my name, become a den of robbers in your view? Yes, I have seen it too” (Jeremiah 7:11).\n\nI want to hold my breath as He declares: “I will banish you from my presence” (Jeremiah 7:15).\n\nMy heart aches when I read: “I will uproot Israel from the soil that I gave them, and this temple that I have sanctified for my name I will banish from my presence” (2Chronicles 7:20).\n\nAs I read these passages describing the loss of God’s presence, David’s prayer reflexively bubbles up: “Do not banish me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me” (Psalm 51:11).\n\nWhen panic about the loss of God’s presence makes our palms start to sweat, we need only to open our Bibles again. God doesn’t give and take His presence away willy nilly. True, because God is holy, our sin and God’s presence cannot co-exist. But let’s pause and remember the miracle of the cross: Because Christ’s death, we are welcomed into God’s presence wearing His righteousness—not our own failed attempts to achieve it.\n\nConsider God’s presence with renewed wonder today, friend. Thank Jesus again that He has made a way for you to be near Him. If you are a follower of Christ, you need not waste a single nanosecond worrying that you will be forced to live outside His presence again. Look no further than the gospel; because of Jesus, we can now experience the joy and eternal pleasures in our Creator God’s presence (Psalm 16:11).\n\n",

It is difficult to fully comprehend a faith that required trips to the temple to sacrifice pure, spotless animals to atone for sin. But until Jesus came to earth, that is exactly what God’s people did regularly to appease God.\n\nThere were so many rules and regulations around temple worship depending on the type of sin committed, which animal you could afford to offer, and on what occasion. As time passed, the rules and regulations surrounding temple worship were manipulated as priests and “money changers” took advantage of those coming to offer sacrifices to God (see John 2:13–21). These misinterpretations and eyebrow-raising exchanges at the temple couldn’t possibly be what He’d originally intended—no, this system needed a lasting solution. A solution that could only come from God Himself.\n\nThankfully, God had a plan for His people that far exceeded a temple sacrifice: a person who was going to outlast a building, God Himself in the person of Jesus. “The Word [Jesus] became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:14). And as Jesus’s ministry grew, religious leaders became frustrated when He proclaimed that He could forgive sins.\n\nThe problem? No more visits to the temple. No more making profit from the people’s sacrifice. No more laws to twist and turn for their own power and control. Now, Jesus declared “something greater than the temple” had come: “mercy and not sacrifice” (Matthew 12:6,7).\n\nBut how?\n\nJesus Himself became the final sacrifice. As He took His last breath on the cross, the curtain that separated people from entering into God’s presence in the temple “was torn in two from top to bottom” (Mark 15:38). Instantly, through faith, we have access to God through Jesus who died for our sins and presents us “holy, faultless, and blameless before him” (Colossians 1:22).\n\nEven though we live in a post-temple world, we often still cut ourselves off from the access we have to God through Jesus. We still put rules around our faith and offer up sacrifices of perfect church attendance, clean and uncomplicated relationships, and spotless pasts. Instead of graciously receiving Jesus’s gift of mercy and forgiveness, we try to earn it on our own and punish ourselves when we make mistakes.\n\nWe cannot forget that the presence of God came to earth and dwelt among humanity, not to condemn it but to save it (John 3:17). Instead of looking for ways to “[condemn] the innocent” (Matthew 12:7), Jesus had compassion for people. And He desired not just our physical sacrifice, but our entire lives.\n\nFor those who trust in Jesus, there is no more curtain in the temple separating us from God’s saving grace. Let’s turn to Jesus, who is greater than the temple, confess and repent of our sin, and give thanks for His everlasting sacrifice that has removed all barriers between us and our Creator God.\n\nWriter and speaker Bailey T.

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Scarlet Hiltibidal\n\nOn the day of Pentecost, God’s presence was poured out on believers.\n\nDo you ever try to conjure up a feeling? Maybe you’re like me, prone to, ahem, an overabundance of feelings at all times. But, though the feelings you have are mighty, sometimes they aren’t the right ones. Maybe you want to feel empathetic, but you feel defensive. You want to feel loving, but you feel selfish. You long to hunger for the Word of God, but the 2020 quarantine was long, and you “accidentally” downloaded apps like, say, TikTok. Ahem.\n\nSometimes we want to feel the right things but pursue them the wrong way. We want to want the Spirit, right? Of course. Because, like 2 Corinthians 3:17 reminds us, “Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.” But how can we have the Spirit and feel the freedom He brings when life is so full of distractions and pains and questions that get us wanting other things we didn’t want to want in the first place? How can we be people who embody the Spirit who lives inside of us?\n\nIn Acts 2, Peter quotes what was once spoken through the prophet Joel:\n\nAnd it will be in the last days, says God,that I will pour out my Spirit on all people;then your sons and your daughters will prophesy,your young men will see visions,and your old men will dream dreams (Acts 2:17; Joel 2:28).\n\nDid you notice that it’s God who does the pouring out? It’s God who IS the Spirit. God is and God pours out. We, on the other hand, are to receive. But we’re not going to recognize what is available to us if we’re distracted, looking at Instagram or news updates more than we’re looking to God.\n\nIn Isaiah 32, we’re reminded of the glorious benefit of being filled with God’s Spirit: “The result of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever” (v.17). We have the Spirit of God. We can be filled with the Spirit of God. We can have and experience His peace. We can live with “quiet confidence forever.” The Spirit who came upon the apostles “like that of a violent rushing wind” is available to all of us who follow Christ (Acts 2:2). We don’t have to conjure it up. We don’t have to strive forever for the feeling of Christlikeness. The Holy Spirit is being poured out. Open the Word. Obey its instruction. Focus on filling more than feeling, and remember this: the work of Jesus Christ has already made you pure. Your sins are already forgiven. You are loved. You are full of God’s power, God’s peace, God’s presence, God’s life, God’s hope. Wow.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nThe people of God are the temple of God; His presence is active in the Church.\n\nI daydream about real estate. While others might be prone to scroll Instagram, “window-shop” online, or have wanderlust—I find myself pulling up Zillow, just for fun. I search for real estate in remote parts of the country as well as on my own street. I slide through listing photos, imagining life within four different walls, as if somewhere out there, there’s a better place for me, some home where I’ll finally have real peace. And of course, a view. But in my soul, I know I’ll never find what I’m looking for out there. The building where I live is far less important than what’s being built inside of me.\n\nGod dwells in holy places. From the ark of the covenant, too precious for human hands to touch, to Solomon’s temple in all of its splendor, God chooses spectacular places to display His glory. But when Jesus came to earth, He did so to change the zip code of God’s powerful Spirit. No longer would we have to go somewhere else to find God. Thanks to Jesus’s work on the cross, God can now build something beautiful, holy and sacred right within me.\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 3, Paul begs Christians to remember this truth: “Don’t you yourselves know you are God’s temple and the Spirit of God lives in you?” (v.16). Unfortunately, when I was a child, these verses in Scripture were all too often weaponized as a message of shame, intended to wag a finger in my face and remind me to remain sexually abstinent. At the very heart, this message from Paul isn’t about rules, but about a powerful, holy relationship. Being a temple of the Lord isn’t about what I do, but about what God is already doing in me.\n\nPAUSE FOR A MOMENT, and think about that. God could have chosen any house, and He chose to live with me, in me, and through me. In a way, it’s as if God looked through all of Zillow, through all time, found my listing—with my broken spirit and my jealous impulses and my numb, unfeeling heart—and said, “I’ll take that house, thank you very much.”\n\nThe good news is that God is a master renovator. He refuses to leave my heart the way He found it. Just like any good house, it only feels like home once you’ve put your personal touch on every wall. The Architect of the Universe knows what walls to tear down. He paints the walls of my soul with His peace, compassion, tenderness, and kindness. When I embrace the power that lives inside me, I can live in response to the Spirit’s heartbeat rather than my own impulses.\n\nConstruction is messy and we are all unfinished. But the good news—perhaps the best news—is that God promises to finish everything He starts (Philippians 1:6). And He’ll live here with me, in the mess, at work until that day comes.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Rebecca Faires\n\nOne day, in the new heavens and new earth, God will dwell with His people as He did in the beginning.\n\nWe wash dishes by hand at our house. We are a big family, so it’s a bit of work, but after years of loading and unloading dishwashers only to find dirty dishes inside, it’s worth it for us. I have three sink basins, in the first I rinse, the second is filled with hot soapy water for washing, and the third has a special hot faucet for rinsing. Above the sink, mounted to the wall, are four big drying racks. Everything smells like lemon and optimism. Once my dishes are shiny and dripping on the metal racks, a child has usually brought in one last bowl and spoon. After that, someone finds a stray coffee cup, and before my dishes have dried, the first sink is full again with ladles, milk glasses, and unnecessary straws.\n\nOur work is never done on this side of heaven. The dishes will never be done. Life is better when I don’t expect a full stop from things that do not stop. The garden does not stay weeded. The beds need to be made every morning. It’s the same regardless of your station in life, the color of your skin, or the size of your bank account. Wealth does not bring happiness. Look at King Solomon in Ecclesiastes, who had limitless wealth, massive power, hundreds of women, and access to any imaginable pleasure the world had to offer. And yet his conclusion, after wearing out every fleshly gratification he could think of, was that it’s all vanity, all just wind and nothing. “All things are wearisome, more than anyone can say” (Ecclesiastes 1:8). And if that guy, with all his resources, found that our hope is not found under the sun, do you think that you’re going to discover something different?\n\nNow, don’t misunderstand me, the fresh glory of a sunrise over mountains and the squishy skin of a new baby and the arms of my husband all hold a true and inexpressible joy for me. The beauty of the world and its people is for our joy. But none of it will satisfy our deepest longings. None of it will make us complete. In the world, no matter how much we love the smell of lemon, there will always be dishes to wash, and our favorite ones will continue to break, and our dogs will die, and our houses will burn, and we will bury everyone we love until they bury us.\n\nBut there is a land where there is no death, no sickness, no depravity, and no shame. And, boy, I hope we will see our pets, because there’s a good girl I sure wish I could see again. We will lay down our tools and run home, into the arms of our Father. He has promised us this: “Look, God’s dwelling is with humanity, and he will live with them. They will be his peoples, and God himself will be with them and will be their God” (Revelation 21:3).\n\nOne day, in the new heaven and new earth, God will dwell with His people as He did in the beginning. We were created for life in our holy God’s presence. Our sin keeps us from coming close to Him. But He comes to us and brings us home. There we find our settled rest, not like guests or strangers, but like a child who is truly home (Psalm 23).\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Jen Yokel\n\nFrom the call of Abram to our inclusion as spiritual descendants, God’s promises to His people are marked by His presence.\n\nJacob had blown it. Maybe he felt shock and relief that he’d actually pulled it off, convincing Esau to surrender his birthright. Maybe he felt the knot of remorse in his gut as he laid down under the stars with a stone for a pillow. Perhaps he tossed and turned a little, regretting and second-guessing, as he drifted off to sleep as the new bearer of the family promise, his dreams filled with light and color.\n\nAngels! Climbing a ladder, up and down. Hearing a voice his father and his grandfather spoke of so fondly, declaring, “I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac” (Genesis 28:13). And that same voice was repeating a litany of promises: good land, countless descendants who would bless the whole world (Genesis 28:10–22).\n\nThis promise wasn’t new. His father Isaac heard it when God told him to stay in a strange land and trust Him through a famine (Genesis 26:1–6). Years before, this same promise led Abraham away from everything he’d known in Haran (12:1–7), and he would continue to hear it for the rest of his life (17:1–8).\n\nI can’t help but wonder about the apparent silences in between, the years of living off strange land and living with family who sometimes stirred up more trouble than blessing. In the midst of unfulfilled plans, God’s voice remained constant, repeating the promise. God still appeared, again and again, to unlikely, fallible people.\n\n“Look, I am with you,” God assures Jacob as the ladder evaporates into the space between dreaming and sunrise. “I am with you, and will watch over you wherever you go” (Genesis 28:15).\n\nMost of us aren’t holding out for a plot of land and kings in our family tree, but I wonder if the land was even the point. Over and over, as God repeated His promises, these men continued to live colorful lives, listening to God yet failing, repenting, and then breaking relationships, only to come home limping in shame—quite literally, in Jacob’s case.\n\nIsn’t that all of us, though, in the great spiritual family of Abraham? We may not trace our blessings by bloodline, but we find them in Jesus, the one who lived a blameless life that only Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob could dream of. Jesus is the one who came to be God’s presence among us, showing us the way, sealing the promise, and blessing the whole world through His life, death, and resurrection.\n\nCenturies after Abraham gazed at the stars and left his homeland behind, a former fisherman and friend of Jesus would repeat the promise one more time: “You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your ancestors, saying to Abraham, ‘And all the families of the earth will be blessed through your offspring’” (Acts 3:25).\n\nThe ultimate blessing is so much more than land, power, influence, or wealth. The blessing is found in Jesus, “God with us” (Matthew 1:22–23), living and dying and defeating death to reunite His family and live with us forever.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Kaitie Stoddard\n\nGod calls His people to take part in establishing His kingdom on earth, and His presence secures our victory.\n\nI played on a smattering of different sports teams growing up. Soccer, volleyball, basketball—I tried them all at some point or another. And while I loved athletics, I was never the “star player” of a team. You know that kid who seems like they were born to swim laps or shoot a three-pointer? I wasn’t that kid, but I got to play on teams with that kid. And having an exceptionally talented athlete on your team is a blessing, because their strength becomes your team’s strength.\n\nWhen I think of God’s power, I think of Him like that star player who carried the rest of our team on to victory. Sure, everyone got to participate during the game, but make no mistake, there would be no “win” if God didn’t show up to make the plays and set the strategy. Honestly, He could win every single game by Himself, but He graciously chooses to involve and work through other players.\n\nThe thing is though, in our daily lives God is often an unseen force leading our team. And so we can make the mistake of thinking we need to be the star player or maybe even call some of the shots. Perhaps we feel God prompting us to help build His kingdom in a specific way, but then we think all the pressure rests on our shoulders. Let me tell you from experience, that is a recipe for disaster. Either we will become prideful and think we really are the star of the show and take all the credit that God deserves, or we will become fearful, knowing we cannot measure up, causing us to spiral into discouragement.\n\nThe book of Joshua reminds us that it is through God’s power, not our own, that His kingdom is built. God directed Joshua to lead the Israelites into the promised land. It was natural for them to be afraid as they stepped onto unknown soil with enemies around every corner, but God continually reassured His people that He would never leave them. He would show up for the game. They only needed to trust and obey. God would carry them to victory, and they would get to participate in the celebration.\n\nJust as God encouraged the Israelites to be “strong and courageous,” He encourages us to do the same. In every good work the Lord has called us to, we must not forget that “the LORD [our] God is with [us] wherever [we] go” (Joshua 1:9). It does not all rest on our shoulders. In fact, God doesn’t need us to accomplish His purposes. We should neither be arrogant nor insecure. Instead, we can be grateful we get to play on the winning team, taking part in the thrill of a game well won, and celebrating the victory that God has already secured. While we work passionately, we no longer sweat the outcome because we know that in the end, God always wins.\n\nWhen Christ went down to the grave and rose up victorious, not even death could defeat Him. Just as we join with Christ in His death, we will one day join with Him in resurrection (Romans 6:5). As Paul says, nothing can separate us from the love of God (Romans 8:39), and that is the greatest prize of all.\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Walking in God’s Presence",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Bailey Gillespie\n\nWe are called to follow Jesus and walk with Him daily, learning about life in His kingdom.\n\nEarlier this year, I started taking long walks at a local park. Because it was springtime, the surrounding fields were vibrant and the aroma of honeysuckle lingered in the air. These walks became my evening pilgrimage. No matter how restless my heart and body became during the day, this steady, put-one-foot-in-front-of-the-other rhythm of movement restored me to balance by the end of each mile. Disharmony and agitation were exchanged for peace and surrender.\n\nDuring a lonely three months, Jesus kept me company on these walks. I’ve always felt closest to God in nature, and there’s something about the art of walking that draws me in even closer. Maybe it’s the sights along the way or the forward movement itself that feels like taking action. Whatever the reasons, I feel invited into something—into new ways of seeing and being that are unlike what I experience sitting under a cozy blanket or at a cherry-red stoplight.\n\nWalking with God isn’t limited to the act of walking, though. After all, what about those who don’t have that physical capacity? Walking with God is about accepting the invitation to keep company with Him. As we intentionally keep company with our Savior, we become more aware of His presence and learn to move to the rhythms of His love.\n\nWhen Jesus walked along the Sea of Galilee, He called out for Peter and Andrew to follow, and the disciples “immediately… left their nets and followed him” (Matthew 4:20). This was an invitation into companionship with Jesus. It was an invitation into new ways of seeing and being. It required action—and not just from their feet but also from their hearts.\n\nJesus also called out to John and his brother James, the son of Zebedee (Matthew 4:21). He then drew those from the regions of Galilee, Jerusalem, the Decapolis, Judea, and the Jordan (v.25). You might call Him a collector of people because of how His presence compelled others to follow. Of course, this wasn’t a lust for attention; it was because there was something about Jesus’s company that transformed people.\n\nIt’s easy to grow distant and inattentive to Jesus’s presence. But because the Holy Spirit inhabits us, we know that God never leaves us. We can’t escape Him, but we can walk toward things that draw us away. This is why Jesus said, “Remain in me, and I in you” (John 15:4). Walking with awareness of God brings us intimacy and abundant life that just isn’t possible apart from a relationship with Him.\n\nThere will always be activities and anxieties that feel urgent. I hope we learn the slow, steady practice of walking with our God every hour of the day because it’s here that we grow in our relationship with Him and learn the rhythms of His love. Whatever our hands find to do, I hope we carry a willingness to drop our nets when He calls and keep company with Jesus.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Claire Gibson\n\nGod is always present with believers always through the Holy Spirit.\n\nA few months ago, we planted two blackberry bushes in our backyard. Since he doesn’t quite understand the concept of “ripeness,” my two-year-old son often walks to the plot and picks off a green or yellow raspberry, only to drop it with disappointment into the soil. “You can’t pick them when they’re green,” I tell him. “They need to stay on the vine.”\n\nGod’s presence is a mysterious concept. At times, I’ve felt His closeness like a breath on my cheek. Other times, I’ve had to trust that His nearness is truth—regardless of my emotions or sensations. If I trust Jesus, then I must take Him at His Word, and He tells me over and over again through Scripture that He will not leave me behind, He will always be present, and even when He is not physically present, that the Holy Spirit will stand in the gap. God’s presence in my life is like the nutrients that move from soil through the vine into an unripe raspberry. Cut off from the source, nothing blooms. Cut off from His presence, I will be nothing but wasted potential.\n\nOften, I can be tricked into believing that in order for me to experience God’s presence, I need a plush upholstered chair, a window that emits plentiful natural light, a cup of just-brewed coffee, a journal, a good pen. Silence. But God is present with me, even when I am not aware of Him. And if God is always with me, then He is with me in the chaos of the day, just as much as He is in the precious moments of morning quiet. In the Great Commission, Jesus is sending His closest friends into oppositional territory, to places where they will be persecuted, hunted, and ultimately, killed. And despite that terrifying reality, Jesus promises them: “I am with you always” (Matthew 28:20).\n\nJesus is with you too—today, yesterday, and forever. No matter what you’re facing. No matter the sorrow past or present, He is here, grieving with us, celebrating with us, growing and filling us with His Spirit, and helping us take steps forward with hope.\n\nThere is no check-list of solitude or calm required for God’s presence to attend to your weary soul. He is here, now. He is with you, always. His presence flows into your heart, whether you feel it or not, whether you see it or not. All you must do is stay on the vine.\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nBY Patti Sauls\n\nIn Christ, our place in God’s presence is secure. We cannot be separated from His love.\n\n“Hey, Patti! So glad you’re here.”\n\nI’ll never forget how Sue, my high school ministry leader, greeted me the first time we met. Even though I had heard a lot about her from my friends, I still felt shy as we walked up her driveway and swung open the back door without even knocking. My friends made themselves right at home, searching Sue’s refrigerator for soda that she always kept well stocked, and plopping down on her kitchen stools. In walked Sue, laughing at our unannounced arrival and welcoming us all. Before I could awkwardly introduce myself, she greeted me by name.\n\nHearing Sue call me by name spoke to my longing to be known and stirred my hope for belonging. It meant the world to my insecure, 15-year-old self, and it means the world to me now. Little did I know that we would spend hours together, that she would share her life stories with me, and that she would explain the meaning of Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection to me. Little did I know that Sue and I would become friends for life.\n\nHearing Jesus describe Himself as the “good shepherd” also stirs my hope for belonging. His shepherd metaphor stops me in my hustling tracks and tugs at my solitary heart. “I am the good shepherd,” Jesus says. “The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep” (John 10:11). This shepherd doesn’t merely offer the bare minimum; He offers His life. He is ready and willing to die in order to protect His sheep from attack. Jesus also says that the good shepherd “calls his own sheep by name and leads them out” (v.3). He doesn’t casually regard the flock as a random collection of animals. He leads them out to pasture where He satisfies their hunger and thirst. Not only that, but He knows each one intimately, and He calls them by name.\n\nDo we hear Jesus’s voice? Do we hear His promises? Jesus promises the ultimate belonging: to be fully known and fully loved by Him forever. He says to every one of His followers, “I see you. I know you intimately. I know your deepest hunger and thirst. I love you. I will provide for you and protect you, even if it means laying down my life.” And, it did—it cost Him everything—Jesus died to divinely and decisively deal with the sin that separates us from God. He died once and for all so that we can be united with Him forever.\n\nEven though it is hard for us to imagine life without end, this is His promise: “I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand” (John 10:28). Jesus protects His flock and seals the deal for those who hear Him and follow. “Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord” (Romans 14:8). He calls each by name to be with Him and to become friends for life—both now and for eternity.\n\n",
