    "devo_summary": "\n\nIt is time we outlaw cliffhangers. It’s fine when they happen between episodes in a series; it keeps us watching, engaged, eager for what’s next. But when we are left dangling at the end of a season, I want to call my congressman. And don’t even get me started on a resolution-less movie. \n\nWe need closure. We need the closing notes of “shave and a haircut.” We want to hear the “two bits.” Conclusions help us understand the point of it all. Today, at the end of Romans, Paul gives us the resounding note for the letter to the Romans—a doxology of praise: “To Him be glory forever!” (Romans 16:27).\n\nEverything and everyone exists for the glory of God. Our churches, our ministries, our jobs, our entire lives are given to us for the glory of the triune God. Do you live this way, submitted to His Word and eagerly living for the fame of His name? What does that even mean? What is God’s glory? God’s glory is the “Godness” of God going public—it is what we see of Him that moves us to worship.\n\nHow do the heavens declare the glory of God? They display things like wonder and majesty. By faith, we see the creative power and brilliance of God as clouds wisp across our patch of sky, gliding to other coordinates on this blue marble dangling in the cosmos. God displays His glory all around us. We are meant to look for it—to see it, to align with it, to spread it.\n\nThe gospel teaches us that we are not the point of our own lives—God is. He saved us for our good and His glory. Living for the glory of God means we agree with who God says He is, and we align our lives accordingly. We submit and serve. We enjoy and exalt. \n\nJesus’ death for our sins and His resurrection for our new life enables and empowers us to behold the glory and fame of God, and to worship Him for it. “Your sins are forgiven for his name’s sake” (1 John 2:12 ESV). We, the forgiven ones, rejoice at God’s glory because we reap the blessings of it.\n\nThe glory of God lasts forever. It isn’t trendy. Nothing will outdo the awesomeness of God. Don’t live in cliffhanger-mode, wondering what your life is all about. Jesus redirects our lives to His—one forever aligned to the glory of God. “Not to us, Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory because of your faithful love, because of your truth” (Psalm 115: CSB).\n\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nThe writer Mark Spragg grew up around horses. In fact, he called himself a “horseboy.” In his memoir, Where Rivers Change Direction, he tells of how he and his father trained their horses to “show them their heads”—in other words, to pay attention or be expectant when they were around. Spragg tells of how he could walk into another man’s corral and know the man—by the way his horses lounged—to be a horse’s, well, rear.\n\nI grew up around churches and the preachers who led those churches. I was a preacher’s boy. At the risk of oversimplification, I found two kinds of preachers: those who would greet all the people before a service began, and those who would be sequestered away somewhere in an office, putting the final touches on a sermon or praying or whatever. I could walk into other men’s churches and know the man—by the way the congregation didn’t expect to be greeted by him—to possibly be a fine speaker who could untie theological knots, but not much of a friend.\n\nThe primary text for today emphasizes how important valuing one another is. We make much about the “last things” Jesus said, and so give great importance to the Great Commission at the conclusion of Matthew’s Gospel. If we’re going to be consistent, we must give equal importance to how Paul concludes the weighty letter known as Romans: “Greet one another” (Romans 16:16). \n\nThis is not some drive-by where you wave at the crowd and use words like “Hey, everybody” or “Bye, y’all.” No, this is personal. People are known by name (Phoebe, Rufus) and also by some details about them—“who risked their own necks for my life” or “my dear friend in the Lord.”\n\nDo you greet people by their names instead of “Hey”? Do you know details about the people you come in contact with every day? Do you know anything about their story—not everything, but at least a few things? I realize some men are naturally outgoing while other men are quiet, even shy. I’ve found that has little to do with being a man who greets well.\n\nYou can tell a lot about a man by walking into his places of influence, and watching to see if the people raise their heads and eyes, expecting to receive the gift of a greeting. \n\nIn the name of Jesus and for the sake of His gospel, greet one another.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nIn any good story, the ending is the capstone. Sometimes it’s climactic. Other times, it’s the final sense of peace in a thrilling and uneasy storyline. In any case, the ending is most often the lasting impression of the work.\n\nPaul’s letter to the Romans is indeed a letter—it’s written as instruction and encouragement to its recipients. It has a greeting and a conclusion, and the meat of the letter is Paul’s teaching on various related subjects that the church in Rome was struggling with. Nonetheless, Paul is still telling a story with his letter.\n\nAs we have traced through this letter, we’ve seen the argument Paul has built: we’re all sinners deserving of death, but we are saved by grace through faith and God calls us to live in light of this fact. The death that sin brings is just as real as the life Jesus brings—but that life has swallowed up death. We can place our hope in this. This is our peace.\n\nAs Paul concludes the letter, he seems to tie a bow on the whole story. He’s not just saying goodbye to some friends; he’s leaving them with an ending to the story. He’s putting a final touch on the picture of God’s glory that he’s just painted.\n\nPaul thanks the church for their kindness, but he makes a greater point: the mission is bigger than just them (Romans 15:26-28). The blessings of Christ—this gospel Paul and all of us have been called to preach—is a worldwide mission. Paul needs to take the encouragement and support of the gospel to both the Jews and the Gentiles. The good news of the gospel, the blessing of Christ, is meant to reach every corner of the world (Matthew 28:18-20). So Paul concludes his letter by asking the Romans to pray for him, and to pray for the Spirit’s work in the world.\n\nDon’t overlook this conclusion. It is not an add-on to an otherwise majestic theological book. It is a theological statement about how the gospel is meant to move and work. The gospel is meant to come to us, and flow through us to others. This is what Paul wants for himself and for all believers. \n\nLet’s heed Paul’s request to the Romans and pray for the blessing of Christ to infiltrate the hearts of people all over the world.\n\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWe are prone to look at success, both worldly and spiritual, as merit, rather than grace. Whenever I think I have grown spiritually, I am tempted to pat myself on the back and feel smug. My heart can take a generous compliment and turn it into entitlement in no time at all. But genuine spiritual growth doesn’t turn our eyes self-ward, nor does it set us on a pedestal to receive honor. Instead, spiritual maturity is manifested in humility and service. This is so because all of life is doxological; it is aimed at one thing: the praise of God.\n\nPaul opens this passage with a clear instruction that grows directly out of this doxological aim: strength, authority, power, and influence are not for self-gain or personal honor. In a culture of self-worship, this is a radical notion. But this radical idea is a hallmark of Christianity, for Christ did not please Himself. He exchanged glory for lowliness, power for humility, and even life for death. This is not just about earthly gains, wealth, and blessing, but about spiritual strength. \n\nFor those who follow Christ, Paul says, the life of service to others is not an option but an obligation, for Christ became a servant. Closeness to Christ leads to the building up of the saints in harmony. It produces the fruit of love and service, not of self-serving pride.\n\nFor this reason, Paul declares, “I would not dare say anything except what Christ has accomplished through me” (Romans 15:18). How easy it might have been for Paul to claim honors for himself for the success of his ministry! But Paul’s great legacy as an apostle to the Gentiles came about because of the grace given him by God. The root and the fruit of the Christian life are all of grace, so that no man may boast except in the work of Christ. Therefore, where grace is at work, gratefulness, service, encouragement and harmony results. \n\nChrist’s glorious humility brought salvation to Jew and Gentile alike, that all nations might bring Him praise. For great is His steadfast love toward us, and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever. \n\nWhen we see the glories of the gospel, delivered to an undeserving and needy people, our tongues are set free to echo God’s praises. May the God of hope fill us with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit we may abound in hope, to the praise of His glory.\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nRemember when you first got your driver’s license? All that freedom, all that road, all that speed. You could go anywhere and do anything—except break curfew or give rides to other teens or to girls or speed or run red lights or take long road trips. Freedom has its limits, at least it ought to, especially to protect the less mature.\n\nIn Romans 14 we see a scenario in which freedom and limits are again in tension. Now that the Old Testament laws of cleanliness and purification were in the past, it meant that any food or drink was pure, so people were digging in. But this caused issues for other believers still more closely connected to the old ways. Their consciences were pricked by this new freedom—it felt wrong to eat or drink these new things, or even be in proximity to them.\n\nSo on one side we have people exercising their freedom in Christ. On the other side we have people abiding by their consciences. Both good things, but in tension.\n\nPaul brings the tension back to the heart. He points out that food and drink are not the issue. The issue is love. People on one side were prioritizing their freedom above the hearts of fellow believers and causing them to struggle. He points out that, clean or not, if food or drink is seen as questionable by someone, then for that person to consume it would be sin. The liberated person should set aside their freedom temporarily in order to show love.\n\nThe church is a body and a family. When one part works in conflict with another, it breaks down. One person’s freedom in Christ cannot be a license to push another person into conflict with their conscience. All actions, attitudes, and convictions in the church must be done and held in such a way as to build up and support. They must pursue love. \n\nThe self-sacrifice of setting aside liberties is an indication of spiritual maturity. It shows that love for brothers and sisters is of greater value than one’s own freedom or pleasure.\n\nBelievers are no longer under the old law, but neither can we grab our freedoms and revel in them for our own happiness at the expense of others. We are free because of God’s profound love and grace through Jesus, so love and grace and Christlikeness must be the marks of our freedom. \n\nSometimes we will revel and eat or drink to our great pleasure. Other times we will sacrifice our freedoms for the sake of our brothers and sisters who have yet to discover the guilt-free freedom of Jesus. This is true maturity proven by love.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nA Christian is to honor God with all the decisions he makes. This means our decisions—what to wear, eat, watch, etcetera—should not be first and foremost about what we like or want, but about what God likes or wants. In whatever we do, “we live to the Lord” (Romans 14:8; 1 Corinthians 10:31).\n\nSimply put, personal preference cannot be the ultimate arbiter of our decisions. We may like how certain clothes look or feel, and that’s good; but the first question we must ask is, “Will this honor God?” We may like certain foods for their nutrition or taste, but the primary consideration is, “Will this be pleasing to the Lord?”\n\nNow, I have good news for you: God is pleased with a LOT of different clothes and foods. From togas to t-shirts, He gives us great liberty. The same is true of food. You can go for the green smoothie or hit up Five Guys for a juicy hamburger. Both are well within the scope of God’s pleasure.\n\nOf course, as you make these decisions, principles of modesty, stewardship, freedom, and wisdom are in play. Paul reminds us elsewhere that, though something may be permissible, it is not always profitable (1 Corinthians 10:23). You have things to think about when you pick out that garment or order from that menu. Your life is not your own (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). In all our decisions, we must honor God and love those around us.\n\nBut remember, it’s a problem if we begin to judge others by our own particular convictions and choices when the Lord has given them freedom. Or worse, when we demand that others conform to our convictions when Scripture demands we extend liberty.\n\nLet me go back to the food illustration. Maybe today you’re munching on carrots and celery for lunch out of a commitment to be a good steward your physical body (Matthew 25:14-30), while your fellow Christian coworker across the table downs a cheeseburger as an expression of freedom and a celebration of the cleanliness of all foods (Acts 9:10-16). Which one of you is right? Don’t answer—it’s a trick question. You both have a biblical basis for the particular choices you’ve made, and you can both honor the Lord in the decisions you’ve made. What’s essential is that you are “fully convinced in your own mind” (Romans 14:5) and that you open-heartedly welcome the other’s convictions as well (Romans 14:1-3).\n\nWe live this way because God has already “welcomed” both carrot and burger eaters into the kingdom of Jesus Christ. It is only through grace, not perfect decision-making, that we will be able to stand at the end of time (Romans 14:4). And so we follow St. Augustine’s old dictum, “Love God and do what you will.”\n\nWhen Jesus is the true unifying point of community life, wine connoisseurs sit down with teetotalers and there’s not a hint of judgment. Meat eaters break bread with vegetarians, and neither looks down their nose at the other. \n\nWhen we’ve truly tight-gripped the gospel, we gain the liberty to hold many other things loosely, or freely. And that’s just how God would have it. \n\nWritten by Nate Shurden\n\n",

You know that feeling, the one where you look at the clock on your bedside table and you realize you’re already a half-hour late to that crucial meeting or final exam? Panic sets in, and your entire day feels completely thrown off.\n\nDid you know that it’s possible to be spiritually asleep? Elsewhere in his letters, Paul seems to use this language to describe those who are either physically or spiritually dead, but here in Romans 13 he seems to be addressing believers (“…nearer now than when we first believed.”). Paul is worried that his readers are going to miss key encounters with the Spirit and power of God because of their spiritual complacency. This concern, of course, extends to us too.\n\nPaul cautions the church in Rome because he can see a cycle forming. Spiritual complacency and sleepiness is not a singular issue, but rather one that ripples outward. When you atrophy spiritually, it affects many of your decisions, which in turn further diminishes your spiritual strength. The cycle Paul is worried about in Romans 13 looks something like this: Spiritual apathy leads to compromising sin choices. These behaviors lead to a more spiritually numb life, which leads to more bad choices, and so goes the cycle.\n\nPerhaps you’ve felt yourself stuck in a pattern like this. It can feel like being trapped on a treadmill where you have no control over the speed. Thankfully, Paul calls us all to a different, more fruitful way of living. “Rather, put on the Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 13:14 ESV). Another translation reads, “clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ” (NIV). \n\nBreaking the cycle of spiritual sleep and unhealthy choices starts with a change in our understanding of who we are. We are meant to see ourselves under, in, and through the life and work of Jesus Christ and His calling over us. With this shift of our internal compass and posture, we are able to combat the cycle of spiritual sleep and distance from God.\n\nIf you’re reading this and feel like you’ve overslept, the good news is that it’s never too late to break your cycle or get back on track. You are a new creation and can be “clothed with the Lord.” In that place of spiritual redemption, you can choose this day “to put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light” (Romans 13:12). One of the thieves on the cross next to Jesus found this to be true in his final moments. It is never too late to make Jesus the fullness of your identity. \n\nTake that step today.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n“Detest evil; cling to what is good” (Romans 12:9).\n\nThis makes me think of two scenes from two of my favorites books.\n\nScene 1: In Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, there is a scene where Darcy is relating the sordid lifestyle of Wickham so as to dispel a rumor that Wickham is a valiant man who has been wronged by Darcy. The opposite is actually true. In fact, Darcy had been generous to a fault with Wickham, and Wickham chose a prodigal lifestyle without ever returning gratitude. In the movie, as he is telling the story, there is a scene of him walking in on Wickham, who is with a woman. And the look on Darcy’s face is one of barely being able to look at what’s happening in front of him because of how evil it is.\n\nScene 2: There is a scene in The Road by Cormac McCarthy when the son asks the father if they are still the good guys. The father had done something to protect them, and the son was unsure if they were still on the side of good. I’ve read this book now at least five times. Each time I am moved by this scene. In McCarthy’s nightmare, where so much evil is surrounding them and demanding things from them, this young boy is concerned about him and his father being the good guys.\n\nI think those two scenes sum up pretty well what Paul is wanting from the Roman Christians and from us in today’s passage. Paul wants us to regard evil as though it is hard to look upon, not because we are judging people and looking down on them in their sin, but because we know the harm evil does. \n\nThis is reason Christ died: to defeat evil once and for all. We are called to detest evil—like Darcy.\n\nPaul wants us also to cling to what is good—the way McCarthy’s boy clung to a desire to be good in the midst of a world where the darkness of evil and suffering and hurt had descended like an ever-present fog. In that scene, McCarthy’s apocalyptic world is not so different from the one we know at present. We’re called to cling to what is good.\n\nWhere do we get help to live out Romans 12:9? At the foot of the most evil act that did the most good: the Cross. The focal point of the gospel is the ultimate act of evil, and God’s ultimate act of detesting it and doing the ultimate good.\n\nThere, at the cross, sin was defeated. Above every event that ever was, this one is good beyond all human measurement. When we need help detesting evil and clinging to what is good, we can cling to the cross and hold fast.\n\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhat does it mean to be a living sacrifice? Consider a couple of everyday examples: marriage and parenthood.\n\nMarriage and parenthood are two of the most significant relationships people have in life. They are also two of the most demanding. Both ask for sacrifices not fully known before the “big day.” How many times have you talked with engaged couples or expectant parents and listened as they painted a glorious picture of what they thought their upcoming life would look like? And if you are already down those roads a bit, how many times have you heard this and thought, They just can’t see how many surprises await. \n\nIf you have traveled the road of marriage or parenthood for any significant distance, you know what’s involved. You know the coordination, the patience, and the sacrifice required. I remember a few years ago when talking with an engaged couple. The husband-to-be said, “You married people are sometimes the worst advertisements for marriage.” Surprised, I asked what he meant. He said married people often seem to take it upon themselves to warn young engaged couples about how hard marriage is. \n\nOf course, some of the “advice” is terrible, like: “Are you sure you really want to give your life to serve someone else?” “You really don’t know what you are signing up for.” “There goes your freedom.”\n\nMarriage is a sacrifice. No one argues that point. Sadly, those who make comments like these don’t seem to get the joy of living as a sacrifice. Laying down your life for another is a learned joy; it comes from humility, from valuing the other more than yourself.\n\nMarriage and parenthood are challenging. They are examples of the biblical call for self-sacrifice. But sacrifice is a beautiful challenge. When we sacrifice for the right things, we are shaped into a humble people, and joy is the result.\n\nIn our Scripture today, God calls us to be a living sacrifices (Romans 12:1). This is a beautiful thing—living while sacrificing. Just like the engaged couple that is unaware of the joyful sacrifices ahead of them, the Christ follower is also blissfully unaware of the joy that awaits him when he learns to function as a living sacrifice.\n\nFollowing Jesus costs us everything, but it gives us everything we really need, too. Consider what it means to present your bodies as living sacrifices, and take courage in the beautiful challenge of resting in Christ in deeper ways than you ever thought possible.\n\nWritten by Jason Tippetts\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nA couple months ago, I was talking with my mom about how we do allowances for our kids. I said to her, “Remember how you used to do it when I was a kid? You’d put all those little sticky notes on the fridge with chores and dollar values on them, and we’d take them off and put them in a pile as we did them?” \n\nMom said, “Oh, we tried all kinds of things.” \n\n“Really? That’s all I remember,” I said, surprised. \n\n“I think we tried that method out for a few weeks, but that’s it.”\n\nIt’s funny how we remember the passage of time, isn’t it? There are things I did as a kid for only a few weeks which I remember as having done for years on end. Now a parent myself, I try all sorts of things with my own kids that might only last a week or two, but I bet when they’re grown they’ll have memories of some of those things and think we did them all the time.\n\nHere’s my point: the older get we, the more trouble we have remembering how things actually happened. We compress timelines. We think we did certain things all the time when we actually didn’t. And some things we did do all the time, we may have forgotten entirely. We can begin to lose our hold on the foundational truths of what really happened. \n\nThis is not so with God.\n\nIn today’s passage from Romans, Paul reminds his readers that God has been at work among His people for a long, long time. The Christian faith is undergirded with realities that have stood since before we were born and will remain long after we’re gone. \n\nGod has given gifts and issued calls to His people that we are likely to forget. Paul’s point is this: Whether we remember them or not, God’s gifts and callings stand. Our memory of them, or lack thereof, does not erase them.\n\nGod’s gifts are what He gives us, the His calling is where He leads us. In our passage, Paul is referring to the gifts God gave Israel (listed in Romans 9:4 as “the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple service, and the promises”) and their calling, which is the promise of salvation. These, Paul says, are irrevocable.\n\nAs with Israel, God gives us both an eternal calling to the life to come, as well as gifts to use in this life here and now. We cannot “forget” them away. Passages like Romans 11:25-36 remind us that God has been at work since the beginning of time. God knows our hard-heartedness and sin better than we remember it, and He gives us a mercy greater than we suspect we need.\n\nAdmit that your memory, when it comes to sin and grace, can sometimes get a little fuzzy. And when you do, rest in the fact that God’s promises do not hinge on our ability to remember them. He remembers them perfectly, and they are irrevocable.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

In a real way, yes they did. They were a part of the experience. There was a bond between the team and its fans, which facilitated a shared moment of joy.\n\nBut imagine a fan bragging about his victory more than the team’s MVP does. Picture him filled with pride, talking himself up, discounting Tom Brady’s feats in the Super Bowl, or LeBron James’s guts in the NBA Finals. It seems a bit ridiculous, doesn’t it?\n\nAs crazy as it seems to think that we not only help our teams win, but deserve the trophy too—how insane is it for us overlook God’s grace when we think about our own standing in this life? \n\nThe Lord’s offer to save sinners through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is a total act of God. Our efforts bring nothing to His saving grace. We can’t muscle our way into the New Covenant. God’s kindness is at work in our salvation. He sustains us. This is what we celebrate. His victory is our victory.\n\nAs men, we are often tempted to compare ourselves to others, seeking a little ego boost to make ourselves feel better. We wrongly think we are more worthy of salvation than others. We may even believe God saved us because of all the great things we offer to His cause. But salvation is about a God who is rich in mercy, even when we were dead in our sins. \n\nPaul reminds us that apples don’t keep the apple tree going. The fruit doesn’t sustain the root. It works the other way around. There is no place for pride in the Christian life. We boast, not in ourselves, but in the cross—in Christ’s death for our sins (Galatians 6:14).\n\nWhenever we are tempted to crank up our self-importance, we must remember that God’s kindness is what justifies our entire lives. Knowing the gospel, reading and enjoying the Bible, serving in the Lord’s name—these are all launched and sustained by His kindness. God gets the credit. He saved you. He is saving you. He will save you. \n\nEnjoy and exult in God’s kindness. Rely on His strength. It’s the only way to live.\n\nWritten by J. A. Medders\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nI hope you’re not like me. But I bet you are, at least when it comes to what we hear in the news these days. I’m suspicious of everything that bangs my eardrums. \n\nDiscerning fact from fiction in this digital age is now a full-time but necessary job. The whole intent behind fake news is the spread of misinformation, hoaxes, bogus stories, or whatever you want to call them. It’s not that this is some new phenomenon, but that the reality of social media brings an ease of spreading the stuff like never before.\n\nPreachers and teachers and writers and communicators of the gospel find themselves in this cultural moment. But all of us as people of faith do too, in a very real sense, for we all have a platform nowadays. And into this fact-checking mentality and culture we bring Scripture, which is filled with strange stories of people being made from dust and ribs, and axe heads that float on the surface of the water. Then there’s that virgin birth that eventually led to a man who claimed to be God but then died but then decided we were all better off with Him alive, so He un-died and is still around today. \n\nIn the minds of some, Christians are the original fake-newsers. Who in their fact-checking mind would believe our message? And what are we supposed to do about it?  To borrow a line from some actual news of late: Nevertheless, we must persist. But as we persist, we must be diligent to not fall into the spreading of what some call the larger category that includes fake news: bad news. \n\nThe good news is that if we’ll simply stop trying so hard to save ourselves, we’ll find that there is One who has already taken care of all that and then some. His name is Jesus, and His ears are poised and ready to respond to all who would call on Him—Jew or Greek, free or slave, American or Arabic, doctor or school bus driver, grandparent or hipster.\n\n“For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Romans 10:13).\n\nWhen we fact-check that verse, we find that the phrase “everyone who calls” means, well, everyone who calls. And we find that “the name of the Lord” is Jesus, that virgin-born man who claimed to be God. And that last phrase—“will be saved”—is a fact you just have to take on faith.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWrath.\n\nThat word is uncomfortable for anyone to hear, much less from God Himself. Isn’t He loving and merciful and kind and gracious? How can a good God be wrathful toward people?\n\nThis passage in Romans 9, among many others, raises tough questions about God’s character. Good questions. Questions that God doesn’t mind you asking and that He can handle.\n\nHow can a good God be wrathful toward sin? He can because He is a good judge, and good judges rightfully hate and push back against evil. We want a God who says, “I am here to not allow injustice to reign as king. I am here to reign as King against injustice.” \n\nBecause God is perfect, His wrath isn’t like ours—it’s an outflow of His perfect love and goodness. And because of this great love, God calls us to place our faith in His righteousness and not our own.\n\nWe’re clay, created by God to worship Him. When we try to earn our salvation, we miss the point of our existence. This was Israel’s greatest mistake.\n\nIf you read through the Old Testament, you see Israel obeying and then disobeying God, worshiping Him and then worshiping idols, ultimately placing their hope in something other than God’s unmerited favor. Israel tried and tried to work for their salvation, and they even questioned God for not rewarding their efforts. But God’s not interested in our white-knuckled efforts. He’s interested in our faith driving us to love Him and others.\n\nGod is not surprised by sin, but that doesn’t mean He’s ambivalent toward it. God is not surprised by unbelief, but that doesn’t mean He’s satisfied with our misplaced worship. In fact, He cares so much that He sent His Son to live the life we couldn’t live and die the death we deserve.\n\nMay we not be bitter or angry toward God like the Israelites, questioning His character because we don’t like something He’s said or done. Instead, let us lay our lives down for Him because of His righteous, perfect character. He is good and He does good.\n\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n",

The ruling will come down and you will be condemned—there’s no way around it. \n\nThe judge looks at the evidence and listens to the testimony of witnesses. But then, in a dramatic turn of events, he picks up the gavel and, striking the bench like a hammer driving a nail, renders the verdict: “not guilty.” \n\nYou and everyone else know you are guilty of the accusations brought against you. But the judge has shown you mercy.\n\nThe reality is that every person saved by Jesus has been shown mercy like this. “Guilty” is the only verdict any of us deserve, and apart from Christ, it is the ruling rendered upon all men and women on this earth. All our wrongdoing and wrong-loving has stood trial, and the evidence against us is insurmountable.\n\nThough we do not deserve to be let off the hook, God is the only judge who can and does show mercy to anyone He desires. Some might say that pronouncing a verdict of “not guilty” upon someone who is clearly guilty is unfair, and they are correct. The unfairness of this forgiveness God grants through His mercy is called grace. Grace cannot be earned, but is a gift given by God to an otherwise hopelessly guilty people.\n\nMercy and compassion are gifts God gives for His good pleasure, but they are not free. God does not just let us off the hook. A price must be paid for our sin. God, in His compassion and mercy, gave His only Son, Jesus, to pay the penalty for our violation of His law. \n\nGod will show mercy upon whom He will show mercy. But He does not set people free without penalty. That would be unjust. He pays the wage of our sin through the blood of His Son. This is our hope: the perfectly just mercy of God, given to those who do not deserve it, through the undeserved sufferings of Christ in our place. \n\nWhat a great mercy! What a great cost!\n\nWritten by Jevon Washington\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n“If God loves me, He will _____.”\n\nWhat words would you use to fill in that blank? Most often when we answer this question, whether privately in our hearts or more boldly, we limit the love of God. We attach His love to the circumstances or results we want. We draw a straight line between God’s love and our comfort.\n\nRomans 8 paints an altogether different picture of a love so much bigger, richer, deeper, and more complete than anything we are even capable of imagining. It isn’t a contingent love or one designed to dole out creature comforts. It cannot be cheapened by our color-by-number effort to depict it. Romans 8 is a masterpiece of God’s love, which is intended for our good.\n\nIn Jesus we live loved. We breathe love and exist each moment ensconced in it. No one can condemn us. No one can judge us. No enemy can assail us. Yes, we will be condemned, judged, and assailed in this world, but no one can remove us from Christ’s love. Our own fears and insecurities, even our own death, cannot remove us from the love of God.\n\nThis profound love of God was ours before we were conscious of it, and will be ours for all eternity to the fullness of our joy and glorification. God promised to complete the good work He started in us (Philippians 1:6), and He will—through the transformative power of His love. \n\nWhen Romans 8:28 says “all things work together for good,” this is what it means: not that every painful or confusing moment will pay out in happiness, but that God’s love will not fail. We will reap its benefits throughout infinite time.\n\nIn this single passage we see the fullness of God—Father, Son, and Spirit—offer the fullness of His love to those who believe. The Spirit intercedes on our behalf when we lack the words or ability. The Son sacrifices Himself as the means—the access—to this rich love. The Father is the ordainer, author, and giver of the eternal plan of love. And we are part of it, in it for all time. \n\nWe may never get what we filled in the blank with above—that thing we attached to God’s love, that trite and limiting expected sign of His goodness. Instead we will be more than conquerors in eternal glory, no matter what we face in this temporal life.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nI turn 40 years old this year—the prospect of which brings several realizations. First, I’ve come to understand that time moves every bit as fast as others told me it would back when I was in my 20s; and, second, I can do just about every physical act I did in my 20—but I need more time to recover. \n\nThe strength and vigor that once marked my life is now replaced with pains and groans. This unwanted experience has served to better my appreciation for the Apostle Paul’s references to groaning in Romans 8:18-25. In that place, Paul sets the hope of glory against the backdrop of the groaning of this fallen world.\n\nWe live in a world that God has subjected to futility (Romans 8:20). Everything around us is groaning under the burden of the fall of man. The fall of Adam brought misery to the entire created order. The turmoil in the world is not simply limited to the turmoil between nations and peoples. There is an innate groaning among all creatures in the animal kingdom, too. There is even a groaning among the trees and vegetation. \n\nAll of creation is crying out for something better. \n\nThis is one reason why the prophet Isaiah speaks of the glories of the new heavens and new earth under the symbol of the lion laying down with a calf in peace (Isaiah 11:6). It’s why the psalmist speaks of the trees clapping their hands at the prospect of the Lord coming to judge the world in righteousness (Isaiah 55:12). In one very real sense, the entire creation is like a woman in labor. This old, broken creation is eagerly anticipating the new creation that Christ has secured and will deliver by His death and resurrection. \n\nThere is, however, also the groaning of the people of God who have been subjected to the sufferings of this present life. This groaning is tied to the persecution believers endure at the hands of unbelievers—both in the church and in the world. There is a tremendous burden in the sufferings believers must bear up under as they press on to the hope of glory. But there will come a day when believers will be set free, in body and soul, from the sufferings of this present age and will be ushered into the inexpressible glory of everlasting life.\n\nWhenever we hear or feel the groans of this life—whether in the created order around us or in our own hearts—we must remember that there will come a day of glory for creation in general and for believers in particular. All temporal groaning will end and eternal rejoicing will commence when Christ comes in glory to raise His people from the dust.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nOctober 31, 2017, marks the 500-year anniversary of the day Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of All Saints Church in Wittenberg, Germany. Luther’s burning conviction was to preach that salvation came to God’s people only by miraculous grace through faith in Jesus Christ. Now, there were other monks and priests at the time with similar convictions, but it seems clear that Luther’s intense study of Romans was his tipping point. In passion and in conviction, he penned and posted a document that would change the face of the Church in the West forever.\n\nLuther knew from Paul’s letter to the Romans that the Spirit of God alone could mark us as children of God. Good works, good intentions, and good gifts to the church or the poor weren’t without value, but they could never stand as being able to save anyone in and of themselves.\n\nThe very good news of Romans is the same very good news of the Gospels: God entered the world, a world that He had created perfectly and that we, through sin, had marred. God sent His Son to bring us life everlasting. This life, as Paul so clearly points out here in Romans 8, comes with and through the gift of the Spirit, Who produces spiritual fruit in our lives.\n\nJesus said to His disciples that we could be recognized by our fruits. There seems to be a very similar thread here in Romans 8. Life in the Spirit is marked by the fruits of the Spirit. Paul is not only giving a promise here, but also a quick spiritual litmus test for our own lives. When we, as believers, examine our hearts, actions, and decisions, do we see a pattern of Spirit-filled movement? Of course, we will still see sin. In fact, both Jesus and Paul acknowledge this. But it should be troublesome to us if we see a continuous pattern in our lives incongruent with the marks of the Spirit.\n\nThe good news is that if you choose to be led by the Spirit, you can have confidence in your place as a child of God. Paul proclaims: “If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you” (Romans 8:11). \n\nThere should be evidence of the Holy Spirit’s work in the Christian’s life. But as Martin Luther contended, that spiritual fruit does not come through our work. In today’s passage, Paul encourages us that we have the power of God—the same power that raised Jesus from the dead—living in us to help us produce that spiritual fruit. \n\nWhen you’ve placed all of the good, the bad, and the ugly in your life at the feet of Jesus, you have the Spirit of God as your advocate. He is the one Who testifies with our spirit that we are the children of God. \n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nMy dad was a pastor, so I was pretty familiar with the Bible growing up. Check that. My dad was a Southern Baptist pastor in the 70s and 80s, so I grew up doing sword drills and memorizing Scripture as part of the air I breathed as a kid. But it seems now there was a lot of the Bible we touched on and a lot we skipped over.\n\nLike Romans, for instance. I knew a lot of this book. I knew the “Roman Road to heaven” in high school. But there was a lot in this book I did not discover until college.\n\nTake Romans 7, for example. I can remember the first time I got ahold of Paul’s own wrestling. I can remember the “aha!” moment pretty well, actually. I remember it so well because of how it made me feel less alone in my struggle with sin. Whether it was in my own head or because I heard someone say it, I walked away with the thought, “so this is the Christian life.”\n\nThat was a pretty revolutionary moment. Up until then I’d bought into the idea that if I was a real Christian, I would not struggle with sin as Paul describes. I would always be saying no to sin and yes to righteousness. What felt like a cosmic battle between good and evil within my own heart, which often made me feel sick to my stomach, was surely a sign of how carnal I was.\n\nBut this was Paul. Paul was the man. And it was clear he struggled too.\n\nThat was a beginning a for me. I felt less alone and more free to talk about my struggles instead of pretend to have it all together. It was a slow process, but it was sure. As one who wanted to follow Jesus and be holy, I was glad to know that struggling was a sign of fighting. And fighting was a sign of following Jesus.\n\nI think we assume sin will kind of fade away from us as we grow in the faith. And that is true to a point. As Paul taught in chapter 6, we have been set free from sin (6:18). But there will be seasons when we struggle in big ways. And as we grow older and wiser, we will see our sinfulness and our need for His grace more clearly. So really, what Paul reveals to us is good news: We will struggle. But that means we are fighting. And fighting is a dead giveaway that we are believing the gospel and following Christ.\n\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nDeath takes more than it brings. It takes not just people, but relationships and dreams and future plans. Death is more of an intruder than an invited guest. It brings tears and a church gathering where awkward small talk with strangers is accompanied by deviled eggs and cucumber sandwiches.\n\nPersonally, I hate death. I hate the emotions it brings and the loss it forces me into. I hate that it even exists. I will admit that my hatred for death is a selfish hatred. To be forced to lose my people, my relationships, and my future dreams hurts.\n\nDeath, at its core, reminds me that I am not in control. This life is not about my plans. Death is a deep reminder that something is seriously wrong. It pushes us to admit that this world, in its present state, is not where we belong.\n\nSo if we don’t belong here, then where do we belong? Where is the place we can settle into without the dread of eviction? This question is ultimately not about a place, but a person: to whom do we belong? \n\nFor the Christian, we belong to Him who was raised from the dead. We belong to the One who is victorious over death. We belong to Christ.\n\nOur Scripture today reminds us that we belong to Him who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God in this life (Romans 7:4). Our lives here matter. We are called to bear fruit, to invest in those parts of life that last beyond the grave. This is comforting.\n\nThough we will all die in some sort of physical way (unless the Lord returns first), we should not dread death as though it ends everything. As the Lord assures us in Proverbs 1:33, “whoever listens to me will live securely and be undisturbed by the dread of danger.”\n\nDeath comes and we are shocked and grieved. We hurt with those who feel the loss. Some of the fruit we grow in this life because of Christ is the peace dwelling secure, without dread, because we know life is ultimately victorious over death. \n\nIn Christ, we have a security that keeps us beyond any death.  \n\nWritten by Jason Tippetts\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWe do our best to keep things open-ended. We try hard to keep all options open. We don’t RSVP to the party too early lest something better comes along. And we do all this in order to remain free.\n\nOr, so we think.\n\nSadly, this loose-ended, unattached freedom proves to be its own slavery. For in refusing to commit to relationships, we’re ensnared by loneliness. In always remaining open to the better offer, we’re trapped by anxiety. And whenever a better offer doesn’t pan out the way we hoped (and that will happen time and again), we spiral into depression. Isn’t it true that sometimes our best attempts at freedom turn into the worst kinds of captivity?\n\nIt’s actually through serving that we find freedom, and we’re all serving someone or some thing. Bob Dylan understood this, as the lyrics from his 1979 hit, “Gotta Serve Somebody,” make clear: \n\nYou’re gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed\n\nYou’re gonna have to serve somebody,\n\nWell, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord\n\nBut you’re gonna have to serve somebody.\n\nDylan is absolutely right. You’re gonna serve something. But whether it’s the devil or the Lord – well, that will make all the difference.\n\nWe learn in today’s reading that the truly free life of the Christian is not so much a freedom from slavery as it is a freedom to be bound to Someone in the right kind of way. Which makes sense if you think about it, for that is exactly how true love works.\n\nWhen we love a friend or a spouse, we willingly restrict ourselves in service to them. We spend money on them. We carve out time to be with them. We give to them our attention and affection. We do this not because we have to, but because we want to—because we love them. Our love for them leads us into a voluntary, life-giving, joy-spreading life of service. It’s the same way with Jesus Christ, “…having been set free from sin, [we] become slaves of righteousness” (Romans 6:18) in love for Jesus Christ. \n\nThe more we see and experience what Jesus has done for us – paying the penalty, breaking the power, and one day removing entirely the presence of sin – the more we can then return His love with love that willingly renders us “slaves of God” (Romans 6:22).\n\nBrothers, take in the love of Christ for you today. Let His love free you to such a degree that you willingly and joyfully enslave yourself to God and His righteousness all the days of your life.\n\nWritten by Nate Shurden\n\n",

Then more stomping. Then stomping with a dash of panic. She ran away, spooked and screaming, “Kill it, Papa! Kill it!” I gently put the eggs down, and ran over to see a mutant, Hot-Wheel-sized, furry, wingless wasp-looking thing. I stomped. It moved. I stomped two more times. The beast ran. Three more stomps. It darted and tried to lose me in the grass, but after a barrage of stomps and some heel-digs, it was all over. I killed what my friends on Facebook identified as a “velvet ant.”  \n\nVelvet ants are infamous for their bites and their toughness. Sin is, too, isn’t it? But Jesus is stronger. The temptations we face are real, no doubt. But our death to sin and new life in Christ are even more real because that life will last for 10 billion years—and more—to come.\n\nWe all have various sins that easily trap us (Hebrews 12:1). But Jesus introduces us to new life, new power, and a new way with Him on the throne. Sin’s grasp on us was formidable, but when Jesus died on the cross He crushed the velvet ant-ness of our sin. Christ conquered and killed what every other power could not. He rose from the dead, bringing us along with Him toward a life of grace, forgiveness, and freedom from sin (Galatians 5:1).\n\nOur freedom from sin’s chains is as real as Christ’s cross and His empty tomb. A no-longer-dead Jesus means a no-longer-doomed-to-sin you and me. Let’s not throw our hands up in despair, overhyping sin’s power and disbelieving Christ’s declaration of victory over it. Let’s receive it. Let’s accept the freedom Christ gives to those who believe.\n\nDon’t buy the propaganda that sin has power over you. Look past it. Look back to a blood-stained hill outside of Jerusalem. See, by faith, a stack of used grave clothes from your risen Friend. Look beyond what tempts you. Look to the One who saves you. \n\nIf you are in Christ, an obituary for your life in sin has been already published, and good news is printed on top: “Dead to sin. Alive in Christ.”\n\nWritten by J.

But while inspiring, the phrase begs for clarification because there are a number of different kinds of love in this world. \n\nC. S. Lewis highlighted four loves. Someone else might insist there are more or less, but the point is there is more than one kind of love. The sacrificial love a spouse practices on a daily basis may indeed reflect the kind of love that wins in the end, while the “I sure do love my Ford F-150” kind of love may not. So it’s not so much a wrong phrase as a vague phrase. Something more specific would serve we the people better.\n\nAnd here’s something. In today’s passage, the Apostle Paul gives us an alternative for “love wins” that covers the necessary bases. In other words, it is just as powerful while at the same time rings even more clear. Paul’s phrase? Grace wins.\n\n“Wait, isn’t there more than one kind of grace in the world as well?”\n\nYes, good catch, as there most certainly is. There is the grace the old hymn writer called “amazing” and there is also the grace said before supper. But leave it to old Paul and that thing called “context” to provide our needed clarity. When Paul uses the word “grace,” he is talking about, as one translator renders it, “aggressive forgiveness.”\n\nNow chew on that for a second or two. Grace is God’s aggressive forgiveness. And if we fancy ourselves as people of grace, which we like to believe we are, then aggressive forgiveness will be a defining characteristic of our lives as well. But far too often we practice something along the lines of dragging-our-heels forgiveness, which is why far too often we are not winning.\n\nSo grab your used copy of C. S. Lewis and drive around in your F-150 and love everything and everybody, okay? But remember—“for just as through one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous.” \n\nWhen all is said and done—when there’s a loser and a winner—grace wins.\n\nWritten by John Blase\n\n",

I would not have said so at the time, but she was my god. I offered sacrifices at her altar daily, and I based my entire life around her wants, needs, schedule, and interests.\n\nI didn’t realize how bad it was until she broke it off. I was devastated. I’ve probably never cried more in my life than I did during that season. My god let me down—and I felt empty.\n\nPaul’s words here in Romans 5 were the words I needed that that time. He tells the church in Rome:\n\nTherefore, since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ… This hope will not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.\n\n– Romans 5:1,5\n\nI didn’t listen to those words at first, but I learned their truth in the midst of my suffering. Placing my hope in another person was futile. She was a sinner just as much as me, and she could never bear the weight of my worship.\n\nPeople aren’t built to be gods. Neither are jobs or hobbies or riches or even our best attempts at good works. None of these can fully satisfy. They’re all created things. Only the Creator deserves and can handle our worship and dependence.\n\nIf we confess Jesus as Lord, we become adopted into God’s family. “And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!” (Galatians 4:6). Our Father loves us and wants us to place our hope in him.\n\nLay your hope—your entire life!—at his feet. He can handle it.\n\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n",

Someone hires a contractor to build their home, and somewhere in the process the builder stops working, stops showing up, and abandons the project. The hopeful homeowner is stuck with a half-finished house, which is about as useful as no house at all. The frustration is great because the homeowner hired the builder to make something very important, and the builder promised to do the work to the end. The break in trust is painful.\n\nWe’re all looking for someone or something to trust in. But we live in a day where words alone don’t seem to carry much weight. Like papers blown away by a gust of wind through an open window, so go the promises people and possessions make, assuring us that we can trust in them for what our souls desperately yearn for most. \n\nThe truth is, only God can satisfy us. \n\nNo labor of our hands nor ascent of our intellects can make the promises of God come to pass. Only God can do that, and we have to trust Him. \n\nFaith is a gracious gift God gives to His children so that we might see His beauty and character. Just as a person might have surgery on his eyes enabling him to see light and color, so the Spirit of God gives us eyes of faith. When life gets hard, God can seem so far away. But when our trust is fastened to the reality of Jesus taking our sin and giving us His righteousness, we can rest in this busy and noisy world knowing we don’t have to go find Him. He has come to us through His son, Jesus. \n\nGod is not a flakey construction worker who stops in the middle of conforming us to Christ’s image. He always does what He says He will do. He will finish what He began. \n\nBecause our faith is a gift from God, anchored in the work of God, we can be certain of His faithfulness to us. “He was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification” (Romans 4:25), and nothing can take that away.\n\nWritten by Jevon Washington\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhat is it that makes a Christian right with God, innocent in His eyes? Can we gain it by being good enough and keeping God’s law? Most of us would pretty quickly answer no, we can’t. We must live by grace. We might even add that living by the law is legalism—trying to make ourselves right through actions and self-will. And we would be right to say this. Mostly.\n\nWhat sets the Christian faith apart from every other religion in the world is that we are not justified by works—that is: we are not made right and upstanding in the eyes of God because of what we do. We recognize that our works can’t accomplish this. We are justified by faith in Jesus’ perfect life, innocent death, and death-conquering resurrection. He is our atoning sacrifice—the sacrifice that takes on the punishment for another.\n\nBut so often we love to oversimplify and create “either / or” propositions out of rich and complex aspects of faith. We say we are saved by grace, not law, and while it is true that Christ’s sacrifice is the most profound act of grace in history, it happened because of the law.\n\nWe needed an atoning sacrifice to fulfill God’s law. The two are inextricably connected—God’s Law and Christ’s sacrifice. Sin could not go unpunished, and innocence cannot be handed out like candy at Halloween. God’s perfect justice led to God’s perfect mercy. So yes, we live by faith in the work of Jesus, and in so doing we are evidence that the law’s requirement was met in Christ.\n\nAnd our faith shows something more: we are now citizens of a new kingdom. We’ve been rescued from darkness and transferred to a “kingdom of light.” And what does it mean to be part of a kingdom but to be under the law of the land? We are under the new law that was ushered in through Christ’s perfect atonement—a law of grace.\n\nWe are governed by grace, shaped by grace, driven by grace. We obey God’s commands by grace and remember Christ’s work by grace. We cling to grace by faith, and so it is that we are saved by grace through faith, and that faith upholds God’s law. This is what makes us innocent in the eyes of God.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhen I was 18 years old, I was accused of a crime that I didn’t commit. In the course of affairs, I had to take a lie detector test—which I apparently failed. I was devastated. I felt guilty, even though I wasn’t. It was one of the worst experiences of my youth.  \n\nThe great irony is that I was guilty of many worse things than that for which I was falsely accused and subsequently penalized. I have revisited that experience from time to time when I consider all that the Scriptures have to say about our sinfulness before God. God’s Word is universal in the scope of its testimony about the sinfulness of humanity when it says, “There is no one righteous, not even one” (Romans 3:10).\n\nThe Apostle Paul went to great lengths in Romans 1 to set out the catalog of sins that mark the Gentile world, which includes our own. Whether it is the sexual sin and idolatry that is widespread among the nations (1:18-27), or the more general sins that mark the day-in and day-out lives of unbelievers (1:28-32), there is manifold evidence of the absolute pervasiveness of the depravity of all humankind.\n\nOf course, when we hear such an indictment, there will always those who will say, “I’m not like that. I don’t do those sorts of things. I’m not that bad.” The Apostle anticipated such objections from those he knew so well—his own countrymen! When he brings the entire Jewish nation before the divine tribunal in chapter 2, he explains that when they condemn others for sin, they must remember that they, too, are guilty of functionally practicing the same things (2:21-24).\n\nIn chapter 3, the Apostle goes on to set the entire world before the all-searching eye of God, thus leveling the the playing field. Paul explains that God gave the Law so that “every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God” (3:19). Weaving together a number of statements from the Psalms (Psalms 14:1-3; 5:9; 140:3; 10:7; 36:1), Paul explains that every part of man has been affected by sin. References to the throats, tongues, lips, mouths, feet, and eyes of men are illustrative of the fact that every part of man has been corrupted. “There is no one who seeks God” (Romans 3:11).\n\nComing to terms with the extent of our guilt before God is part of coming to see our need for Christ. Apart from the grace of God in Christ, we are spiritually hopeless, helpless, and powerless. \n\nThanks be to God that He seeks and saves sinners.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n",

Good guys and bad guys, gunslingers and cattle ranchers, A Fistful of Dollars and A Few Dollars More.\n\nThese revered moments gave real-life weight to the words of men like Clint Eastwood, Robert Duvall, and the Duke himself, John Wayne. Wayne’s call for a code is one I’ve always respected. Of course many different moral systems could be nested under the umbrella of Wayne’s famous saying. For some it’s the golden rule, and for others it’s a fiery pursuit of justice. For still others it’s the commitment to live the way their folks raised ‘em.\n\nCreeds and codes are good. But they meet their greatest contest when the proclaimer of the code fails to keep it. Whether by deliberate choice or in the face of overwhelming opposition, codes eventually break down. What we do then says more about us than any ethic ever could.\n\nPaul was confronting this gut-wrenching sort of breakdown in his letter to the Romans. For his Jewish readers, and for the God-fearing Gentiles among them, the Old Testament law was their code. It was, in it’s purest form, a gift from God. But over-legislation by the religious leaders of the day made the law a crushing and impossible burden to bear.\n\nPaul knew from personal experience that even a deeply focused life dedicated to keeping the code would fall short. This murderer-turned-apostle had seen firsthand the mangled and marred disasters that could be found in the wake of law-based living.\n\nHis question, “Do you dishonor God by breaking the law?” begs a response; and his original readers would have intuited that. He is asking us to admit our hypocrisy. Why? So we can truly live. Rather than living as creatures of the code, Paul is calling us to be people living under lavish grace.\n\nIf we feel compelled to boast, let us boast in our weakness and in God’s unmerited grace and mercy. Codes, laws, rules—these things are fundamentally helpful, but our hearts are flawed. This is why God entered our litigious and punitive world: to reset the whole broken order. Certainly, we are encouraged to live lives of virtue. I think this is where the Duke got it right. But what sets us apart as New Testament believers is our ability to hand over our shortcomings, and to lay our failures at the feet of a gracious God.\n\nBoast not in your virtue, boast not in your vice, but rather each day offer thanks to God that He covers it all. We fail, each of us, in keeping the code. But we have a Great High Priest who stands over it all. In Him, we can seek virtue, be released from the condemnation of the Law, and find a freedom and grace in Jesus that far surpasses it all.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nChildren can get easily frustrated. \n\nWhen something they try goes poorly, even if they haven’t been at it very long, they can get very frustrated. The other day I saw it happen. A kid was shooting baskets. The first shot was bad, and he got mad instead of shooting again. Maybe you know a child who loses it when he drops something, or who sits down with math homework and is beside herself with frustration in 30 seconds or less. Kids’ sensitivities run deep. One day this may serve them well, but in the moment it can be maddening.\n\nMy kids struggle with this, but they come by it naturally. When I am tired after a long day at work, I tend to do the same thing. The slightest thing can cause me to spiral into being quite a grumpy dad. Spilled coffee grounds. Not being able to watch a baseball game. Running out of bacon.\n\nWhen I get frustrated with my kids’ behavior, it is a condemnation of my own behavior.\n\nI thought about this when reading Romans 2. Paul is trying to get religious people, or at least people prone to judging other’s behavior, to see that when you are critical of others, you set yourself up for condemnation. Whether you do this with laws everyone agrees on or the Law of God, you are really pronouncing a guilty sentence on yourself. Why? Because we’re guilty of doing the things we condemn others for.\n\nBut Paul doesn’t merely want his readers to feel guilty; he wants them own it, to know it. He wants them to buy into the idea that we all suffer from the same human condition. We are all guilty before God. We all deserve His judgment. The problem is, this is so hard to get people to see. So Paul uses their own moral compass against them. Paul’s goal, of course, is not just to make sure we know our own guilt. He wants us to trace the line from guilt, to need, and then on to the good news of what God has done in Christ.\n\nWhen I see bad behavior in one of my kids, I acknowledge that behavior is wrong and I tell them they need to stop. But because I do the same, I am also judging myself and revealing my own need. I need to experience the mercy and grace of the cross afresh, just as Paul’s original audience may have needed to experience it for the first time.\n\nWe must acknowledge our incessant need for Jesus. And when I do this—when you do this—we can know God’s kindness that leads us to repentance (Romans 2:4).\n\nWritten by Matthew B. Redmond\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nIn a world full of self-worship and runaway passions, Romans 1 is arresting and sobering. This isn’t the sort of thing most folks want to talk about at your local coffee shop or over dinner and drinks. Paul directly confronts sin and brings us face to face with God’s righteous wrath. Indeed, God’s wrath, says Paul, is revealed against all ungodliness.\n\nThe judgment described is frightening. Perhaps the most frightening phrase is this: “God gave them up” (Romans 1:24). When our hearts are blind, false, desirous of carnality and evil, He gives us what we desire. To get what we want in this life is sometimes—dare I say most of the time?—not blessing, but judgment.\n\nIn his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” So also, unrighteousness anywhere is a threat to righteousness everywhere. The minute we begin condoning evil, justifying our selfishness, and excusing our pet sins, instead of repenting of them, we are asking for judgment: for blindness, darkness, waywardness, folly, debased minds, and perverse passions. \n\nIt is a slippery slope, and there aren’t any pit stops along the way. There is no “sort-of” righteous, no “halfway” committed. There is no neutrality. There is wisdom or folly, life or death. “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and discipline” (Proverbs 1:7).\n\nHowever, this talk of judgment isn’t a load of pessimism. God’s righteous wrath is the only good response to a world of sin, and even to our own rebellious hearts. It flows from the simple fact that God is good and holy. \n\nGod’s holy wrath was visited upon Christ on the cross. His righteousness triumphs; yet in the midst of His wrath, He remembers mercy. Because of this, it is possible to both tremble and to trust.\n\nI am comforted by Paul’s words in 2 Timothy 3:9: “But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all.” Folly can’t be hidden. Ungodliness and unrighteousness will be revealed for what they are. This is both sobering and glorious news. I am provoked to repentance for my own folly and unrighteousness, and also to thanksgiving for God’s faithfulness and grace. \n\nMay Christ Himself keep us and guard us from our own folly—from the love of self and the love of the world, from presumption and from pride. May He keep us in His grace, that we may fear Him all the days of our lives. Thanks be to God, and to Him alone be the glory!\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWelcome to Paul’s letter to the Romans. \n\nMartin Luther said of this epistle, “It is well worth a Christian’s while not only to memorize it word for word but also to occupy himself with it daily, as though it were the daily bread of the soul.” Why did Luther hold Romans in such high esteem? Because, he said, “this letter is truly the most important piece in the New Testament. It is purest Gospel.”\n\nWhat makes Romans so special? While all Scripture is God-breathed and equally valuable, Romans is unique in that it is the most comprehensive, well-organized expression of Christian doctrine assembled in one place in the Bible.\n\nLuther wasn’t the only person who regarded this letter in this way. Paul did too. We see this in today’s reading when Paul actually gives us his thesis for the entire book:\n\n“For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.”\n\n– Romans 1:16-17 CSB\n\nThe reason Paul is so eager to preach Christ is that he believes the gospel has the power to give life where there is none. Jesus alone is the way to salvation. The message of Christ is free to all and powerful enough to save those who believe. \n\nPaul wrote this letter to explain to Jewish and Gentile converts alike what it means to believe in and be redeemed by Jesus Christ. This book reaches back deep into the Old Testament. It walks us through the origin and problem of sin, the reality of guilt, the impossibility of saving ourselves, and the ultimate rescue we’re given in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nRomans is meant to be thorough—a practical, theological guide for the follower of Jesus. This book calls believers to trust Christ as it unfolds what it means to live by faith. By faith we anticipate our eternal home. But by that same faith, we also learn how to live as followers of Christ in this world. Romans speaks to both.\n\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ, Paul says, is the righteousness of God—meaning it is the way by which we are able to stand in the presence of God and live. In the work of Jesus, we see the character of God on display. In this letter we find a God of compassion, patience, and justice. We see unfathomable love displayed to complicated and broken people—a generosity of grace and mercy.\n\nWhether you are new to what it means to follow Christ, or you have read this letter many times over, read the book of Romans as though it is telling a single story—the story of how God rescues us through the sacrifice of Christ.\n\n Written by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

Scripture tells us that we are wired for eternity, created for an everlasting kingdom, drawn by the Spirit to His goodness which will be fully and forever established at the end of this age.\n\nNostalgia is a strong emotion. Most of us tend to think of that feeling as a longing or yearning for a romanticized version of what once was: a childhood memory or a favorite family vacation, the most beautiful autumn day or a moment of athletic victory and the accompanying rush.\n\nI’m not the first to point it out, but I think it’s fair to acknowledge another type of nostalgia that is rooted in a holy longing for the future. Because God has set eternity in our hearts, we actually remember glimpses of what will be.\n\n“How long till the end of these wondrous things?” (Daniel 1:6). This question posed by the unknown man could just as easily come from any of us. How many times per week do you find yourself praying, lamenting, thinking, or even saying out loud, “How long?!”\n\nProbably too many times to count.\n\nIn the deepest seat of our person, as we are re-created and redeemed, the image of God in us has tremendous hope because it pre-celebrates the day when all shall be made new. When we lose sight of that eternal perspective, we ask “How long?” from a place of grief and fear. When we hold on to a God’s eye view of this life, when we recall the work that Jesus completed on our behalf, our hope and remembrance of the future is further established.\n\nAs we live in the tension of this world, between Eden and Eternity, we can cry out “How long?!” but we can also cry out in victory and hope no matter our circumstances because we remember the work of Jesus, which helps us not only confess “this too shall pass,” but “this too shall be healed.”\n\nAs was promised to Daniel, “Go on your way to the end; you will rest, and then you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance at the end of the days” (Daniel 12:13). For us, to “go your way,” is to walk in the way of Jesus, remembering eternity and living for it as He set it in our hearts.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhen we misplace our allegiance, bad things happen. In Daniel 11, we read about rulers who leave cities in ruins and many thousands of people dead. We see power change hands several times. Alliances are forged and broken. Each successive ruler seems more deceitful, arrogant, and bloodthirsty than the last.\n\nWhat are we, the modern reader, to make of all this? How can we connect our 21st century experience as Christ-followers to an obtuse summary of long-past historical events? Because we believe the whole Bible is “inspired by God and is good for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, [and] for training in righteousness” (2Timothy 3:16)—not just the inspiring verses embroidered on pillows and engraved on knickknacks in our homes, but even the obscure, seemingly irrelevant passages—we must lean into Daniel 11 and trust that God is giving us more than a dry history lesson.\n\nSo, let’s dig past the facts and look for patterns. First, we must recognize the precariousness of power. Even the mightiest and seemingly indomitable terrestrial forces eventually crumble and fall. There’s always someone bigger and stronger on the horizon looking to swallow up everything in their path.\n\nSecond, we note that the primary focus of the leaders in Daniel’s vision was their own glory and supremacy, no matter the cost. Indeed, all history reveals that as rulers become intoxicated by power, the more likely they are to demand unquestioning allegiance from those they conquer and govern. Often, they require their subjects to forsake prior loyalties, whether to governments or gods. This was as true in ancient Mesopotamia as it has been throughout the span of human affairs.\n\nWe might not be able to make a direct connection between our current experience and the historical details of Daniel’s vision, but we can be sure about how God expects us to respond to the authorities and idols that demand our devotion. Ezekiel warns God’s people about what will happen if they continue to pledge allegiance to other gods (Ezekiel 20:4–9), and over half a millennium later, Jesus mourns the result of Jerusalem continually ignoring God in favor of lesser authorities (Matthew 23:37–39).\n\nDaniel tells us that “the people who know their God will be strong and take action” (Daniel 11:32). To know God—that is, to taste and see that He is good (Psalm 34:8)—is to recognize Him for who He is: all-mighty, righteous, just, merciful, faithful, and fully invested in restoring His people. The appropriate action in response to a God like that is to prioritize Him above all other allegiances. We must follow the model of Daniel and his friends, who, under threat of persecution and death, refused to bow before any authority other than God Himself. Under His loving authority, we can rest in His strength and not in our own. Apart from God, there is no Savior (Isaiah 43:11). Where is our allegiance? To whom do we ultimately bow? What master do we truly serve?\n\nWritten by Alex Florez\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n“He’s such a little angel,” a new mom proclaims about her infant. “Look at their angelic faces,” grandparents gush about their grandkids. “He’s my guardian angel,” a woman says about a man who protects her. These are the contexts in which we most often mention anything about angels, conjuring up images of cute, cherubic, innocent, and helpful beings.\n\nBut that isn’t at all how the Bible describes angels. Throughout Scripture we see people trembling with fear and falling on their faces before these messengers of God. Daniel 10 is no exception. Of seeing the heavenly being for himself, Daniel concedes, “No strength was left in me; my face grew deathly pale, and I was powerless” (Daniel 10:7–9). Why? The description of the angel Daniel encounters surpasses our imaginations; he is glorious, beautiful, awe-inspiring, and terrifying. He is a warrior, but not like any earthly, sword-wielding hero. He brings with him heavenly glory and power.\n\nThe magnitude of angelic grandeur is so magnificent that it makes two aspects of this text stand out. First is the battle the angel is waging. He does not say he is there to protect Daniel, to sit on his shoulder and be his good conscience. The angel says he has been waging war against the prince of Persia and will continue to do so against him and the king of Greece. He is not dueling a demon; he is fighting a cosmic spiritual battle for the good nations. He is the workman of God striving for good and righteousness in the world. The spiritual struggle described in this text makes our World Wars look like brief playground spats, for the spiritual struggle is over continents, over eons, and for the destiny of the very world.\n\nWhich brings us to the second aspect of this text that stands out. After seeing the massive scale of spiritual conflict going on, it is easy to be overwhelmed. What is our place? What do we matter? The angel tells Daniel: “Don’t be afraid, you who are treasured by God. Peace to you; be very strong!” (Daniel 10:19).\n\nPeace? How? Because all who are believers are greatly loved. We can be strong and of good courage because God fights for us.\n\nYes, the fight is too big for us. We should feel like Daniel did: weak, speechless, helpless. But the words the angel spoke to him are echoed throughout Scripture. The book of Ephesians tells us that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against cosmic powers, and then it goes on to equip us with spiritual armor and weaponry for the fight (Ephesians 6:12–18). Our weapons in this fight are not of flesh but have divine power so that we can destroy arguments and lofty opinions raised against the knowledge of God (2Corinthians 10:2–5).\n\nTexts like this should rattle us. They should wake us up to the reality of evil and the even bigger reality of God and His power. He is big enough to embrace us with love and assurance while fighting our battle for the good of the world. And it is a battle He will win—or rather, a battle He has won, in Christ.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWe’re always in a battle. It isn’t really a fight against circumstances or people, but against powers, principalities, and spiritual forces (Ephesians 6:12). We certainly see the battle raging around us in the actions of men and nations, but it also rages in our own hearts.\n\nWhen Daniel read from Jeremiah 25, he didn’t forget for a moment this very biblical principle: prayer is the proper act in all times and circumstances. The particular fulfillment Daniel anticipated was one of great joy, the deliverance of Jerusalem. It would seem like the time to jump up and down and celebrate. It would be easy to be forgetful, to reflect only on the coming relief from exile, and forget that his chief call was to fix his eyes not on circumstance, but on God.\n\nDaniel’s prayer reveals much of what he believes about God, and it reveals how we, too, can walk with God in all circumstances (Daniel 9:18–19). With the promise of restoration at hand, Daniel focuses on God’s righteousness, remembering that the initial captivity of God’s people was due to His judgment against their sin and idolatry. Recognizing the people’s rebellious and forgetful nature, and not presuming God’s mercies, Daniel prays before his holy God, “Lord, righteousness belongs to you” (v.7). It’s a prayer that offers us clear principles for how we can approach the Lord and His instruction.\n\nFirst, God’s faithfulness doesn’t eliminate our need for prayers, but galvanizes it. In the face of blessing, the natural inclination of the human heart is self-congratulation. We like to take credit for the good stuff (but not the bad), and tell ourselves, “I must have done something good to deserve this.” But Daniel reminds us that every good gift is from God (James 1:17) and depends wholly upon His grace. Therefore, blessing should humble us.\n\nSecond, prayer fixes our thoughts on God, rather than the world. Worry, fear, materialism, and selfishness all grow dim in the light of Christ. Our petitions are first and foremost to be for His glory as we seek first the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 6:33), just as Daniel petitions God to act for the sake of His own glory.\n\nThird, prayer recognizes both God’s goodness and greatness. Because of His goodness, we are called by His name and enjoy the security and joy of salvation. Because of His grace, we can approach Him with confidence that He hears all our petitions and confessions. Because of His greatness, we know He has the power and authority to answer.\n\nAnd He does answer! God responds to Daniel not only with the assurance of Jerusalem’s restoration, but with the promise of “the Anointed One” who will satisfy the need for offerings and sacrifices and judge the destruction of the destroyer (Daniel 9:25–27). Once dead in our sin, we are now made alive in Christ Jesus. It is by grace that we have been saved, which means that the righteousness of our Lord is now our righteousness as well (Ephesians 2:1,5; Daniel 9:7).\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Vision of a Ram and a Goat",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nWe are all fascinated by the end times. The proliferation of post-apocalyptic films and literature, and the numerous theories, interpretations, and speculations regarding books of end-times prophecy, raptures, judgments, and visions are everywhere. And, the end times are not a fascination merely of Christian culture, but of all cultures—from the Ragnarok of the vikings, to the promise of global warming, environmental doom, and nuclear self-destruction preached in the present—we want to know how it all ends. Knowing the end is part of knowing the present. We know ourselves now both by the record of the past and the hope or fear of the future.\n\nOf course, our knowledge is limited. We’d like to have a clear timeline, a chart with breakdowns of all the specifics. Remarkably, that is very much what we find in Daniel 8. Daniel is given not only a spectacular vision of the future, but also a specific interpretation: “the vision refers to the time of the end” (Daniel 8:17). Yet at the end, we are told he still “could not understand it” (v.27). This is the same response we see in Jesus’s disciples when He very specifically explained His coming death, resurrection, and ascension. Every time, no matter how clearly the matter was imparted, those who received the foretelling could not understand. And so it is with us. Even when God gives us everything we need to know, we’re still left scratching our heads.\n\nBut that is part of the good news. God does not do His work according to human wisdom or to suit human wishes. He does not deliver His message to cater to our curiosity. He delivers to us a clear revelation of His nature, His character, His sovereign providence—and calls us to simply walk in it. We don’t have to understand everything. We are called to simply trust Him.\n\nAnd that trust is not misplaced. The events foretold to Daniel in this vision of the ram and the goat would not take place for another 350 years, yet they happened with the rise and fall of the Medo-Persian empire, the ascension of Alexander the Great and the division of his kingdom, followed by the abominations of Antiochus Epiphanes. \n\nWhile this 20/20 hindsight doesn’t fully satisfy our desire for apocalyptic insight, it is also not the main point of scriptural prophecy. Prophetic interpretation, even for Daniel, was never designed to boost pride. It was and always is about God’s work in the world. And while our initial understanding is dim, the end point of biblical eschatology is always optimistic. The angel that appeared to Daniel assured him that all these things would come to pass by God’s own righteous decree, and “not by human hands” (Daniel 8:25). In the same way, Christ spoke to His disciples of the end times, saying, “Be courageous! I have conquered the world” (John 16:33).\n\nThough we may, like Daniel, be “overcome and sick for days” when we look at the state of the world, and wonder how it can all possibly come to good, we are called to remember that our good and righteous God is at work. Therefore, we can rise like Daniel, and go about the business that God has set before us. We can be of good courage, knowing that the end of the story is not the triumph of wickedness, but the victory of Christ. We can take heart, because it does not depend upon us, but upon God, who is at work in time, in space, in history, and will guide the present and the future as He has guided the past. Though the world may appear to be upended by affliction, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, and danger, in all these things we are more than conquerors in Christ who rules and reigns forever (Romans 8:37–39).\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Interpretation of the Vision",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nScripture records many of the promises of Jesus. Two of those promises that have often brought me comfort and hope in the midst of challenge are seemingly contradictory, but time and time again they’ve proven themselves to work in unity. Take Jesus’s words in John 16:33: “You will have suffering in this world,” but “Be courageous! I have conquered the world.”\n\nDaniel lived in a time of exile. He was held captive in a foreign land as his home and countrymen were systematically dismantled and dispersed. He did not need many reminders that followers of God experience trouble in this world. And while his life predated that of Jesus by several hundred years, it seems that Daniel also understood clearly that God-fearers need not fear the powers of this world. \n\nThere are entire books written about our passage for today. And there are many, hotly debated interpretations that attempt to parse out various aspects of Daniel’s vision. One thing that interpreters seem to universally agree upon is that, in the end, God establishes His kingdom and kingdom people forever and ever. Daniel proclaims in no uncertain terms: “But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever” (Daniel 7:18). Amen. May it be so. \n\nWhen all is said and done, when all the kingdoms have conquered and then in turn fallen, when all the histories have finally been written, God’s purposes and love will be perfectly and eternally established and experienced. \n\nDaniel lived in exile, but Daniel hoped in the future kingdom. I think most of us can identify with that. Most days we experience life somewhere between exile and the fullness of the kingdom. We live in between the promise of suffering in this world and Jesus’s encouragement to have faith that He has more than conquered this world.\n\nIn almost any 24-hour period, we ebb and flow between the lows of “now” and the hope and healing of “not yet, but coming!” Kingdoms come and go but the City of God is forever (Revelation 11:15). It will outlast and overcome every oppressive system, every injustice, and every wrong doing. It will bring peace and freedom, wholeness and stability. \n\nDaniel was greatly alarmed by his vision. He saw death and destruction at the center of every one of those kingdoms and their pursuit of power and control. But he knew the end of the story. And so do we. Take heart, saints of the Most High. \n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nIt’s so easy to reduce our impression of Jesus down to a mild-mannered teacher and healer who went around saying encouraging things to people who were having tough days. But the Jesus of Scripture is also one of unmatched power and authority. One that compels people to fall on their knees in worship. Today’s passage serves up a powerful image of this Jesus.\n\nYou’ve seen it in a hundred movies: the good guys finally meet their mysterious foe, only to discover he is so much more powerful than they ever could have imagined. The beast rises from the ocean and blocks the light of the sun. The harbor looks like nothing more than a puddle. Military missiles bounce off like nerf darts. The only realistic response is to abandon all hope. \n\nDaniel 7 opens like one of these movies. Daniel dreams about four beasts, which verse 17 says are four kings who shall arise out of the earth—perhaps Babylon, Medo-Persia, Alexander the Great’s conquest, and the Roman Empire, respectively. The creatures are strong and horrifying, the kind you would presume would destroy you like you destroy a mosquito. They take your breath away and sever your courage. And each one is more terrifying and ruthless than the one before. No doubt the exiles of Judah would have felt the chilling reality of this imagery.\n\nSuddenly, a throne room—or better, a courtroom—comes down in their midst (Daniel 7:13). God Himself, the Ancient of Days, sits on the center throne. Here Scripture gives us a rare personified description of God the Father: He has pure white hair, clothing white as snow, a chariot-like throne of fire. Thousands surrounded Him, serving Him and listening to Him. Here, the Lord is not like the four ferocious beasts, hungry for blood and bent on destruction. Instead, He is the picture of strength that comes from wisdom and the power of righteousness. He doesn’t inspire fear, but worship.\n\nIn a moment, the greatest beast was destroyed, and the power of the others was taken away. Then, from heaven, came the Son of Man, to whom the Ancient of Days gave all authority and dominion. Daniel says God gave Him glory and a kingdom which would draw people from all nations to worship and serve Him. His dominion would never end and His kingdom would never be destroyed.\n\nIn Mark 14:62, Jesus says the Son of Man that Daniel saw was, in fact, Jesus Himself. He wasn’t just referring to His first coming, but His second, when He will descend to establish His kingdom forever. When you think about Jesus, or pray, or worry about seemingly insurmountable obstacles, picture this Jesus. \n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Daniel in the Lions’ Den",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nDaniel’s deliverance is probably one of the most triumphant narratives in the Bible. The Black preacher would assert that Daniel was not in the lions’ den, but the lions were in Daniel’s den. God transformed the nature of the lions that they served as a mattress and pillow for Daniel as he slumbered all night. Situations and undesirable scenarios do not thwart the hope of the people of God. God’s power is not limited to the powerful and dominant but ever present in the life of God’s people. \n\nWe miss an essential aspect of the sixth chapter of Daniel by neglecting to give attention to the devotion of Daniel to God. Daniel’s devotional life became evident even to his colleagues, so much so that they desired to use it against Daniel. Daniel has the reputation amongst his colleagues that faith does not simply serve as a guide but most importantly as an anchor into who he is. His devotion to God led to a deeper experience of the omnipotent essence of God. And God invites you and I to experience this same power today.\n\nThree times a day he got down on his knees,\n\nprayed, and gave thanks to his God,\n\njust as he had done before (Daniel 6:10).\n\nDaniel displays that a life devoted to God yields a hope for the people rooted in divine courage. When King Darius declares himself the only “deity” the people should pray to, Daniel continues to commit himself to God and His ways. Despite the king’s decree, Daniel submits himself, offering a “yes” to God and a “no” to Darius, at the cost of his political affiliation, and potentially, even his life. \n\nOur devotion to God invites us along a journey of commitment. Daniel exhibits to us all that we should choose character over comfort. Social status and standing do not satisfy a heart that desires to be in communion with God. Just as a tea bag placed under heat will render a liquid with the contents that it is composed of, devotion met with disturbance reveals the true essence of our commitment to God. \n\nIn the swift transitions of life, our devotion serves to draw us closer to God and not simply to drift away. Daniel’s devotion leads us to explore how to live out our beliefs in a world that seems to discount the devotion of believers. Daniel’s adversaries envied the reputation and rank of their colleague. They knew that the place to push Daniel would be in his devotion to God. But Daniel’s steady confidence and peace in the Lord only point all the more to God’s divine faithfulness to those who trust in Him. \n\nWritten by Cameron Thomas\n\n",

    "devo_title": "The Handwriting on the Wall",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhen I was five years old, my father left and never came back. Ever since, an urgent, demanding question has flashed in glaring red letters on the walls of my heart: ARE YOU GOOD ENOUGH?\n\nFor so long, the answer to this question was simple: No way. I’m not good enough. Every day my father chose not to return, that self-evaluation set like concrete, creating an increasing sense of inadequacy. I have often whispered to myself, in the quiet of my soul, that I will never be good enough for anyone, for any purpose, under any circumstances.\n\nI think everyone faces some version of the same question: Am I good enough? Do I measure up? These questions and the varied answers that spring into one’s consciousness comprise the driving forces of our decision-making, our thoughts, our relationships, our actions, and naturally, our understanding of self.\n\n“You have been weighed on the balance and found deficient” (Daniel 5:27). The writing on the wall may have been directed at Belshazzar, but Daniel’s interpretation feels personal.\n\nBut I have something Belshazzar did not. Notice Daniel’s insight in verse 23 when he tells the king, “You have not glorified the God who holds your life-breath in his hand and who controls the whole course of your life.” What Belshazzar lacks is reverence for the one true God; it’s his failure to acknowledge the supremacy of the Lord that renders him inadequate.\n\nGod’s expectation for human beings is perfect holiness (1Peter 1:16), and through the lens of my own lifelong battle with self-worth, I recognize that I fall far short of perfect holiness. At my worst, I am self-absorbed, obsessed with avoiding pain, and addicted to pleasure and comfort. If being “good enough” for myself has been difficult, then being good enough for God on my own merits is impossible.\n\nHowever, there is something new in me that refutes the slanderous voices within. My faith in Jesus—a gift from God, not something I earned for myself—allows me to stand at peace with God (Romans 5:1). Because of Jesus, God sees me as holy and blameless (Ephesians 1:4). I am no longer a little boy who wasn’t good enough for his earthly father; I am an adopted son whom God is pleased to call His own (v.5).\n\nAs a son of the King, I glorify God and trust Him as He directs the course of my life. No longer am I bound in the mire of self-loathing. Instead, I humble myself before God, confident that in the shadow of His wings (Psalm 63:7–8) my heart can soar to the heights of heaven. Because of Jesus, I discover that I am good enough—not because of what I’ve done or haven’t done, not because of who I am or who I am not. I am counted as treasured and prized (1Peter 2:9) because of who He is and what He has done for me.\n\nWritten by Alex Florez\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Nebuchadnezzar’s Proclamation",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nThroughout the middle books of the Old Testament, Nebuchadnezzar’s kingdom was the greatest rival to Judah. In Daniel 4, God finally intervened and humbled the ruler of Babylon who had twice besieged Jerusalem, humiliating her kings, plundering and destroying the temple, and then carrying off God’s people into the exile. But it was not for any of these acts alone that God caused Nebuchadnezzar to fall from power. It was the king’s pride.\n\nWhile Nebuchadnezzar tried to establish himself as a god, unsettling visions haunted his dreams. He confided them to Daniel: a tree towering over the earth, a pronouncement from heaven, and it was cut down and watered by the dew. Daniel explained that Nebuchadnezzar was the tree, and God was going to cut him down. The prophet advised the king to repent. Instead, Nebuchadnezzar stood at the height of Babylon and proclaimed that the city existed to display his “majestic glory” (Daniel 4:30).\n\nBut before he could finish saying this, his mind left him. Nebuchadnezzar left the luxury of Babylon and lived as an animal in the wilderness for seven years. Instead of royal food, he ate grass and his hair and fingernails grew until he was compared to an eagle. This lasted until he repented. Finally, instead of his own glory, Nebuchadnezzar humbly praised God:\n\n“For his dominion is an everlasting dominion, \n\nand his kingdom is from generation to generation” (Daniel 4:34).\n\nProverbs says that “pride comes before destruction, and an arrogant spirit before a fall” (Proverbs 16:18). As I reflect on this story, I’m convicted to repent of my own pride, knowing that it is not a “minor sin.” It’s not as if Nebuchadnezzar was prouder than you or I—after all, he was wrong about his boast, and if his pride was reason enough for God to humble him, then everyone will be humbled. Daniel warned Nebuchadnezzar, “Separate yourself from your sins by doing what is right…. Perhaps there will be an extension of your prosperity” (v.27). Only after years spent in the wild, did Nebuchadnezzar heed Daniel’s advice. And after he did, his prosperity was indeed extended.\n\nIf God has already driven you into the wilderness and torn down the idols you built of yourself, see in this story how His discipline is also His grace. When Nebuchadnezzar’s reckoning came, it led him to repent. The dew of heaven that soaked Nebuchadnezzar was not judgment but provision. (Remember how the manna came with the dew for the Israelites during their own time of humbling? [Exodus 16:13–14]). This great villain of the Old Testament has a happy ending, praising God; his own testimony is recorded in Daniel 4. If God’s grace extended to Nebuchadnezzar, then it extends to everyone.\n\nBefore his humiliation, Nebuchadnezzar boasted of building Babylon. After his time in the wild, he admitted, no one on earth can put their achievement against God’s and ask him, “What have you done?” (Daniel 4:35). God uses despised things, like Nebuchadnezzar’s madness and wildness, to destroy our illusion that we are the architect and builder of our own kingdoms, that the world exists for us. No one can boast in God’s presence (1Corinthians 1:31).\n\nWritten by David Chaniott\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Delivered from the Fire",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod’s people always had enemies: the Egyptians, the Philistines, the Midianites, the Babylonians. And in almost every situation, the story was the same. The enemies would make life for Israel miserable. And when enemies became occupiers, they’d make idolatry tempting. Submitting to an invading ruler’s gods often brought worldly comforts. But though they forgot Him, God never forgot His people. He’d send deliverers to rescue them. Sometimes the rescuers would actually go out and fight the enemies (think Gideon or David). But others would take action by serving wisely from within the government. That was the case in Babylon. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego simply waited out the exile with defiance until God showed up.\n\nThat approach wasn’t easy, because these three friends served under a megalomaniac. Nebuchadnezzar was the mightiest king in the world, and he knew it: “Build a golden statue. Make it look like me. Gather my officials. Play a song about me. Then, bow down and worship!” Can you imagine? Nebuchadnezzar loved to hear people say he was the greatest; he wanted everyone to worship him, and he wanted it so badly that he started issuing threats: “Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire” (Daniel 3:6).\n\nHow do you live in Babylon under that sort of rule? Sometimes it’s hard to stand up for what’s right when everyone around us is more concerned with their worldly success, when others love their lives more than God. But these three men stood defiantly. When the haughty king heard about their protest, he was furious. (I imagine him turning bright red and calling them some pretty nasty names.) Nevertheless, the friends replied: “If the God we serve exists, then he can rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire, and he can rescue us from the power of you, the king. But even if he does not rescue us, we want you as king to know that we will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up” (Daniel 3:17–18). Incensed, the king turned up the heat and threw the three dissidents into the furnace.\n\nI’m sure Nebuchadnezzar thought he’d proven his point, but when he squinted and looked into the furnace, he said, “Look! I see four men, not tied, walking around in the fire unharmed; and the fourth looks like a son of the gods” (v.25). The three friends stood together, and their God stood with them. Even narcissistic Nebuchadnezzar was forced to admit, “There is no other god who is able to deliver like this” (v.29).\n\nGod saved His people in their darkest moment. He was with them, like Jesus took on our sin and stood in our place on the cross. That reality gives us hope when we’re living in a world that too easily bends to ungodly rule for the sake of comfort. In the midst of the temptation to bow, we can stand defiantly, too, trusting in the one, true God. After all, we still serve a God who delivers through fire.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Daniel Interprets the Dream",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nI’ve had some weird dreams in my life: being kidnapped by the Wicked Witch of the West, having a co-worker as a parent, finding myself at school with no pants. Never, though, have I been so troubled as to seek interpretation for these as seminal messages for my future, let alone threatening the lives of any who failed to interpret them well. When we read Daniel chapter two, we see that this is the very threat Daniel found himself on the receiving end of.\n\nDaniel acted boldly. Just as we saw the presence and power of God with Daniel in giving him the interpretation, we see it in his response to the king. He entered Nebuchadnezzar’s court and declared that no person could interpret the dream, but informed him that “there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries,” one who will make known its meaning (Daniel 2:28). He claims no wisdom or power of his own, but instead, boldly points to the true God as the source of this revelation.\n\nIn doing so, Daniel acts in faith and exemplifies what Jesus later declares in Luke 12: “Anyone who acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him… the Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what must be said” (vv.8,12). Daniel not only acknowledged God before men, but he did so in the highest court in the land and at risk of His own life, believing God would give him the words to say. He trusted and he obeyed, believing in “the God of the heavens” who would “set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed” (Daniel 2:44).\n\nThe dream itself tells of a succession of kingdoms with varying levels of glory and strength which crumbled by “a stone [that] broke off without a hand touching it” and “became a great mountain that filled the whole earth.” Daniel’s interpretation of this dream is striking as well (Daniel 2:34,35). He isn’t just predicting future power clashes and regime changes; he is describing how God gives power to kings, and then goes on to say “in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed” (v.44).\n\nSo in the presence of the most powerful man in the world, as a prisoner in the midst of humiliating exile, Daniel proclaims the everlasting supremacy of Christ’s kingdom. We often think of this only in terms of individual souls being saved, but Daniel is foretelling what Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 15: “He must reign until he puts all his enemies under his feet” (v.25). Jesus came to save and change hearts, but He is a conquering King as well, defeating all enemies, all evil, all death (v.26). And unlike every man-built kingdom, His reign will last for eternity. For Daniel, these must have been words that simultaneously made him fear for his life yet gave him hope for the future. We know the story, though. We know how Christ struck the death blow to death, once and for all time. So for us, these are words that are sure and sealed and fill us with hope for His return.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nNothing saps hope like an impossible situation. Anyone who has been in such a scenario knows that helplessness is often the herald of hopelessness. Given his impossible circumstances, we might expect to find Daniel drained of all hope and faith, but surprisingly, we discover the opposite to be true.\n\nDaniel’s impossible situation is two-fold. First, King Nebuchadnezzar is demanding what his advisors say no one on earth can do: to not only interpret the king’s dream, but to divine the content of that dream out of thin air. When they inevitably fail this impossible task, the king gives orders to execute them, their families, and all his other advisors, Daniel included. This is the first problem, and it’s a big one.\n\nThe second problem has less to do with the impossible task and more to do with the impossible man, King Nebuchadnezzar himself. As the saying goes, “Absolute power corrupts absolutely,” and this is on full display as the king of Babylon shows his penchant for arbitrary violence. The impossible task aside, if he survives this conflict, Daniel has to find a way to live in a nation that is ruled by the whims of this impossible man.\n\nYet, in the midst of it all, Daniel maintains his hope and trust in the Lord. You see, Daniel knew that despite all the raging of King Nebuchadnezzar, the Lord’s good purposes for him would prevail. Nebuchadnezzar may be king of the world, but Daniel knew that the King of heaven is the one who “changes the times and seasons; he removes kings and establishes kings” (Daniel 2:21). What fueled Daniel’s hope and faith was the truth that no power on earth could stand against the plans of the God of the heavens.\n\nThere is no greater example of this truth played out in the annals of history than in the story of Jesus’s resurrection. No situation is more hopeless than the grave, but even death could not stop the redemptive purposes of God. Christ’s resurrection exposes the futility of any effort to thwart the progress of God’s kingdom. Neither the mightiest of kings nor the cruelest of deaths can impede God’s good purposes for His people. This truth sustains our hope and faith in the face of seemingly impossible situations.\n\nAt the end of their rope, Nebuchadnezzar’s advisors lost all hope, while “Daniel praised the God of the heavens (v.19).” The prophet knew that nothing could derail what God had in store for his life, and the same is true for us today. No matter how bleak our situation, there is nothing that can spoil God’s plans for us. Let that truth be the fuel that animates our hope and trust, come what may.\n\nWritten by Collin Ross\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nI’ll never forget the first day I arrived on my college campus. There was a desire for a freedom in my soul that I had not experienced as a child—at least I thought it was freedom.\n\nI wondered what it would be like to touch, smell, and taste the things that I had been kept from by my parents. I just wanted to test and see what the world had to offer. The parties, the alcohol, and the access to explore cheap relationships all enticed me even as I sought to stand strong in the faith I’d received.\n\nBut within a few short days of arriving, my appetites began to be saturated with worldly desires. And it was within days of arriving that my faith would be challenged by my professors. That campus would become a battlefield for my soul and a war fighting for my appetites, education, and good name.\n\nI imagine the experience I share with many was what teenaged Daniel faced as he left the ordered and comfortable land of Israel for the chaotic and hedonistic world of Babylon, forced to venture out of the sure safety of his people’s protective arms for the dangerous wild of the Chaldeans.\n\nYet Daniel’s faith in the Lord was incredibly strong. He had determined in his heart to be faithful to the living God, even as a foreigner and an exile to the kingdom of Babylon, knowing that the food, wine, and worship that they had in store for him would be detrimental to His relationship with God and the rich heritage he had known among the people of God. And as an act of generosity, the Lord granted Daniel both kindness and compassion from those he would serve (Daniel 1:9).\n\nIt was Daniel’s grit that gave him the determination to stand apart. But it would be God’s favor combined with Daniel’s intelligence that allowed him to remain in good standing with the officials and the king. He used his influence and winsomeness to position himself to honor God and honor the king, simultaneously.\n\nThe story of Daniel not defiling himself before the king while growing in influence in the Babylonian empire gives us a front-row seat to what faithfulness looks like in the corrupt world we find ourselves in today. It’s a reminder that we, too, can choose to live above sin while still living in this world. And it’s an encouragement for us to engage with the world around us while not compromising the holiness that God seeks to display through our stories.\n\nWe can have both: We can honor God and we can honor humanity, His creation. We can live for the kingdom of God while still living in the kingdom of darkness. But it requires abstinence and submission; abstinence from what we know would displease God and submission to the people He puts in our path as leaders and authorities. Daniel knew how to stand in the balance. Oh, that God would empower us by His Spirit to stand firm in the faith like Daniel.\n\nWritten by Jonathan Pitts\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nNot to beat a dead horse, but pandemics stink. One of the toughest realities of living in a COVID-19 world, outside of the horrible medical realities, is how it has disrupted our lives. At the start of the year, things were humming along as usual for most of us, and then, in a matter of just a few weeks, the world started shutting down. We lost our rhythms and routines. We lost our ability to plan for the coming months. We lost many of the plans we’d already made.\n\nGoing through something like this helps prepare us to come to a book like Daniel, because Daniel tells the story of an exile—Judah’s captivity in Babylon. Life in Judah was moving right along when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came and carried off many of God’s people to live in another land (Daniel 1:2), under the control of another ruler, surrounded by the gods of another religion. Appreciate the difficulty and trauma this must have added to the already complicated lives of the people of Judah.\n\nIn these opening verses, we catch a glimpse of King Nebuchadnezzar’s strategy. To get Judah to accept their fate, he took some of the royal, noble, and beautiful people of Israel into his own home. There he would teach them the ways of the Chaldeans. They would eat at his table, read his literature, learn his language, and—in a final coup d’état—worship him. He wanted the people of Judah to abandon their faith in God and embrace a culture where the people bowed before the king in worship.\n\nAmong these people we see four names: Daniel, Meshach, Shadrach, and Abednego. What would they do? Where would God be in the midst of their suffering and trials? That’s where the rest of this book goes.\n\nAs we begin reading through Daniel, ask yourself these questions: In the face of exile, how did God’s people respond? What role did God play in their trials? What did faithfulness look like? What did unfaithfulness look like? What does exile for God’s people look like today? Where are people of faith being urged to abandon faith in order to assimilate into another culture? For what purpose? What does it look like to remain faithful?\n\nWhenever we get disoriented, it can be hard to remember which way is up. When we’re in a position of weakness or change, it can be difficult to know how to move forward in healthy, upright ways. Good news! One of the themes running through the book of Daniel is that God is exceedingly more present and active than anyone would have imagined. And that God is the same, yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8).\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nIf you’ve never taught a room full of 5th graders a Bible lesson right before lunch, let me paint you a picture. With each passing minute, they become increasingly restless, and they cannot resist the urge to squirm, wiggle, sigh, and fidget. There I am, pouring my heart out, and I can’t understand why they aren’t sitting still and listening with rapt attention. But you see, I am the one thing standing between them and having lunch, laughing out loud, and enjoying each other’s company. In short, I don’t stand a chance by the end of class.\n\nParents and teachers attempt to train children to exhibit self-control, though it runs counter to everything their bodies and minds are telling them: Get up! Move! Run! Laugh! Move some more! They seem determined to rail against any directive to control themselves physically. (It would seem the training has not been effective.)\n\nMeanwhile, I’m facing my own internal struggle. As I push through my lesson, straining toward the finish line, I grow more and more impatient with the rising tide of squirminess. My heartbeat quickens as initially innocent wiggles evolve into a full-blown mutiny against my authority. At this point, I am outside of myself; any internal fortitude of my own has been exhausted. There’s nothing I can do by my own strength to meet this ostensible insubordination with the peace, patience, gentleness, and joy that I know the Lord desires from me, and that I know the children need.\n\nIronically, I’m standing before them essentially preaching the “more excellent way” of love in Christ, and I am on the verge of demonstrating the exact opposite. How much easier it would be to raise my voice and foam at the mouth in order to regain control of the class! Students sense the end of class, and some of them start to pack up because they just can’t sit still one moment longer. Chicken tenders and chocolate milk are just around the corner, and they have forgotten I exist. As I feel myself teeter over the edge, I am convicted by the words of Matthew 23: I am like a whitewashed tomb, appearing righteous and clean on the outside, but filled with hypocrisy and wickedness (vv.27–28).\n\n“Now everyone who competes exercises self-control in everything.\n\nThey do it to receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable crown” (1Corinthians 9:25).\n\nBut I simply cannot manufacture the self-control I require. If I rely on my own strength, I become a blind and ineffective guide to the precious children He has placed in my care. I need to remember that the Spirit of the Lord lives within me, bringing freedom. As I contemplate His glory, I recall His promise to transform me into His image (2Corinthians 3:18). I need the Lord Himself to bear the fruit of His Spirit within me. Only then can I exercise the self-control I need to love my students as Jesus would have me love them—with justice and mercy, with faithfulness and patience, with peace and gentleness.\n\nWritten by Alex Florez\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Gentleness",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nI believe it was C. S. Lewis who once said that “humility is not thinking less of yourself, it is thinking of yourself less.” In a world where the individual self reigns sovereign, this is a profound challenge. I’d imagine that most of us think about ourselves far more often than we consider others.\n\nPaul describes “gentleness” as the fruit of the Spirit in our lives, which has a direct tie to our consideration of others. To be gentle, one must be humble. If one is not humble, they will be self-absorbed and consider themselves superior to others. When you view others as inferior, it will manifest in actions that are aggressive, bitter, and angry.\n\nAs we search the Bible for the archetype of gentleness, the example of a shepherd should come to the forefront of our minds. The imagery of shepherding is interwoven in the scriptures as a metaphor for provision, protection, and guidance. More often than not, we tend to focus on the actions of shepherding—that is, leading the flocks through harsh environments, protecting them from predators. However, if we consider the motivation behind these actions, we come to see that a shepherd leads and protects the flock because he cares for them. Isaiah provides a good picture of a caring shepherd:\n\nHe tends his flock like a shepherd:\n\nHe gathers the lambs in his arms\n\nand carries them close to his heart;\n\nhe gently leads those that have young rest (Isaiah 40:11).\n\nIn the ancient world, Bedouin shepherds knew every member of their flocks in terms of their birth circumstances, history of health, eating habits, and other idiosyncrasies. To know each member of the flock requires time and attention. A true shepherd demonstrates both strength and tender compassion. When Isaiah speaks of a shepherd who carries the flock close to his heart, we are given this imagery of tender reassurance, encouragement, and hope. Notice that the shepherd gently leads the flock by paying attention to their needs, and in doing so, aims to refresh the weary who are downtrodden from the wilderness of everyday life.\n\nAs we reflect on our own relationships in an effort to cultivate gentleness, it is important that we assess our disposition towards others. Are we gentle and self-forgetful, that is, placing the needs of others over our own? Or are we self-absorbed in such a way that we become bitter and angry when others’ needs get in the way of our own agendas?\n\nConsider for a moment those whom God has placed around you. Who is burdened and needs support? Who is down and needs encouragement? Someone should come to mind. And your initial thought might be, “But, that will require a lot of time and energy on my part.” The good news is, because gentleness is from the Spirit, God will empower you to exercise His gift if you seek His help in prayer. As you finish reading this devotional, spend a few minutes asking God to soften your heart toward those He has placed on your mind. Ask Him to provide practical ways for you to serve them, and thus, walk in the Spirit of gentleness. In doing this, you will live according to God’s will and be conformed to the image of Christ, the Good Shepherd.\n\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\n“God, would you send me someone that I can pour my life into? Would you give me a guy that I can help to know you better?”\n\nThis is a heartfelt prayer I’ve prayed for years. I always thought that would mean me leading a Bible study at Starbucks or having a small group of guys in my home that I’d read Scripture with. There was nothing wrong with those things, but they never seemed to be His answer to my prayer. But I’ll never forget the day that God opened my eyes to how faithful He had been all along.\n\n“Margret and Aaron are coming to stay with us,” my wife said.\n\n“For a few days?” I asked.\n\n“Uh, I’m not sure, but Aaron is trying out for a professional basketball team, and I told them they can stay as long as they need to.”\n\nI knew Margret well, but Aaron I barely knew. That would change quickly because for a full summer we hosted this young married couple in our home. He taught me how to look respectable with a basketball in my hand. They spent time with our daughters and gave us breaks from parenting. It was a really beautiful time.\n\nI moved about my life very normally in front of them. But one day, sitting at dinner, I held a short devotional with my family like I always do when we sit together. At the very end, Aaron asked me a question that changed everything. “What was that?” he asked. It took me a while to figure out what He was asking, but he had never seen a father sit around a table and lead his family in God’s Word. I laughed and gently described “family devotions” to him. From that point on, I realized that God was using the faithfulness He had developed in me to help develop faithfulness in Aaron. And it felt like I was doing nothing at all. Now, years later, Aaron teaches his own two young sons around their table.\n\nAnd that’s the God we serve. He is “the faithful God who keeps his gracious covenant loyalty for a thousand generations with those who love him and keep his commands” (Deuteronomy 7:9).\n\nHis faithfulness was preparing me to disciple Aaron. His faithfulness was drawing Aaron deeper into who He was. His faithful love is continuing on to Aaron’s next generation of sons as he faithfully passes on what God is doing in his own heart. And it all started with a prayer calling on God’s faithfulness.\n\nI now look back and realize there were more answers to my prayer. There were Kameron and Brianna. There was Isaac and there was Rodney. God was faithfully weaving the love of Jesus in and through me to others in His own ways and in His own time. All I needed to do was to call on His faithfulness, trusting He would answer. Trusting that He would work through me. And I still do. Will you call on His faithfulness today, expecting Him to give it to you and display it through you?\n\nWritten by Jonathan Pitts\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Goodness",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nGood food. Good company. Good morals. Good taste. Good times. Good vibes—we love good things, right? We use the word “good” in a wide variety of contexts. We tend to talk of goodness as a thing unto itself, a judgment call made on the basis of personal preference. We think of goodness as positivity and happiness, even of trite and passing pleasures, so much so that we are prone to lose sight of the profundity of its meaning.\n\nBut Scripture is clear: goodness does not exist apart from the presence of God. Consider Jesus’s interaction with the rich young ruler in the Gospel of Mark. When the young man called Him “Good Teacher,” Jesus confronted him: “‘Why do you call me good?… No one is good except God alone’” (Mark 10:18).\n\nGoodness is only found with God. Goodness is His glory, His favor, and His presence (Exodus 33:12–19). Goodness is His activity for the blessing of His people, and for a witness to the nations (Psalm 31:19). Goodness is the root of joy and gladness, the ground of fruitfulness, and the satisfaction, consolation, and refreshment of the soul, found only in God (Jeremiah 31:12–14). Goodness is the fruit of God’s own light, and transforms us in Christ (Ephesians 5:9).\n\nYet, despite this, we are prone to look for goodness in just about every other place, even in “good” things: in family and friends, in tranquility and comfort, in victory and success, in hard work and productivity, in neighborliness and hospitality. But if we supplant the goodness of God with the virtues of our own efforts, we have utterly failed to understand the God of Scripture. To look for the good life in any place except the gospel is folly.\n\nGod alone is good, but God is also astoundingly generous with His goodness, so much so that He offers it to us. He makes His goodness ours. Moses beheld the goodness of God as it passed by him on the mountain (Exodus 33:18–19), but Christ reveals to us that same glory, not on a mountain, but by the indwelling of His Spirit. “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). He, with all His goodness, dwelt among us, and His Spirit now dwells within us.\n\nThis, then, becomes the foundation of the fruitful Christian life. If there is to be any excellence or virtue in our walk in this world, we must abide in Christ and walk by His Spirit. The evangelistic call of the gospel is never simply an offer of escape from judgment. It is always also an invitation to come to the bounty of God’s dwelling place. Men may search for success, joy, comfort, and peace in many places, hoping somehow to find the good life on their own, but true goodness can only be found where the Spirit of Christ is, the mark of the Holy Spirit’s fruitfulness in our lives.\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Kindness",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nI’m not exactly sure when it happened, but at some point I started ending my prayers by thanking God for His kindness to us in Christ. If you are part of the church I pastor, you hear me say it at some point in every service. It was never an intentional thing—more of a response. But the older I get, the more I associate the essence of the gospel with kindness.\n\nFor us to understand this aspect of the fruit of the Spirit in our own lives, we should ask how it works in God. God’s kindness that leads to peace is intensely relational. It’s about more than being nice. It’s about being aware of others and relationally accessible and available to them.\n\nFor us, that looks like thinking of others before ourselves (Philippians 2:1–4). Kindness desires and pursues another’s well-being. It is seeing when someone you know is hurting, perhaps at church, and not walking past them, but stopping to see how they are. Kindness is marked by careful listening and general warmth, giving the gift of unhurried time to others.\n\nThe Holy Spirit works to bear this fruit in the character and actions of His people so that we might reflect this aspect of God’s character as light in a dark world. For this to happen, the Holy Spirit must also uproot things growing in our hearts in the place of kindness. Just as there is fruit of the Spirit, so there are weeds of the flesh—weeds the Holy Spirit uproots so that His fruit may flourish. What opposes kindness in your heart? You might say meanness, but it’s not that simple. Because kindness is so relational, the opposing weeds to the fruit of kindness are not meanness, but disconnection and ambivalence. Kindness grows in the place of not caring.\n\nCan you see the gospel in the Holy Spirit’s promise to grow kindness in us? The Spirit desires to move us from ambivalence toward others to a kindness that leads to peace. This begins with our relationship with God. Because of His kindness toward us in Christ, we can know we are at peace with Him, and live in the confidence of that peace. Because “when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, he saved us” from our sin and ourselves (Titus 3:4–5). This freedom enables us to engage our hearts with others—to live relationally connected lives. Rather than being disconnected and ambivalent, we become vessels through which His kindness flows to others.\n\nKindness is the art of seeing people as they really are, esteeming their worth as God does, and seeking to love them in ways that build up and nurture peace. And this is exactly what the Lord has done for us in Christ.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Patience",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nAt one time or another, you have probably heard someone say, “Patience is a virtue.” Have you ever wondered why we need that reminder? I don’t recall ever needing to be convinced that love is a virtue—or joy or peace or any other facet of the fruit of the Spirit. Yet, somewhere along the way, we needed to be persuaded that patience was something we should seek to cultivate in ourselves. Why is that?\n\nFor starters, patience doesn’t fit into our fast-paced society. Our culture demands quick results. Delayed gratification means there has been a breakdown that needs fixing. When we’re out to eat, and we grow frustrated that several minutes have passed since our empty cup was refilled, notice how we diagnose the problem: The waiter is inattentive. The restaurant is too crowded. The manager needs more staff. For most of us, cultivating a patient spirit never comes into view—it’s not our natural response. Yet, the Preacher is right when he says, “A patient spirit is better than a proud spirit” (Ecclesiastes 7:8).\n\nPatience is not our natural response, because it is the fruit of the Spirit. The ability to endure hardship with an even mind is one that must be sown in our hearts by our Creator, who knows what it means to be patient. Though He had every right to do so in His dealings with Israel, the Lord never said, “I don’t have time for this.” Though they hurled at Him the insults of idolatry, violence, and faithlessness, the biblical authors describe God as one waiting patiently to show them mercy and compassion (Isaiah 30:18; 2Peter 3:9). Look no further than Christ enduring the cross on our behalf to find the epitome of the Lord’s patience. Patience may not be our natural response to hardship, but it is in the DNA of our God. Who better then to be the one to cultivate this virtue in our hearts?\n\nThere will always be problems in our lives that cannot be quickly solved, prolonged hardships that give birth to sorrow. In the Christian faith, patience has long been understood as a form of protection in these seasons of life. Sorrow is a paralyzing force. It has the power to overwhelm and dominate a person’s life and make them feel like progress is impossible. Patience is our spiritual protection against despair because it helps preserve us in the midst of hardship. This is why James urges impoverished Christians who are being exploited by rich landlords to be patient (James 5:7–8). James isn’t uttering a useless platitude. He’s offering life-giving counsel: the path to joy in the midst of suffering is paved with patience.\n\nPatience may be out of vogue in our contemporary culture, but it is essential for navigating this life. It connects us to the hope that is ours in Jesus by serving as a buffer against anxiety, frustration, and despair. Most of all, it connects us to the love of our patient God, seen most clearly in Christ Jesus.\n\nWritten by Collin Ross\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nHiroo Onoda fought the Second World War for thirty-two years. Though the war ended in 1945, a few scattered enclaves of Japanese soldiers had no way to know this. Onoda was one of the last of these holdouts. Cut off from his home, constantly on guard, he battled with police and sabotaged farms at the edge of the Philippine wilderness for twenty-nine more years.\n\nOnoda’s war continued until Norio Suzuki left Japan and came after him. Suzuki joked that finding Onoda in the jungle would be like finding the Abominable Snowman—but find him he did. Still, Onoda would not surrender without orders from his superior officer. Within weeks, Japan sent Onoda’s former commander, a Major cum bookseller, to the Philippines. On March 9th, 1974, Major Taniguchi delivered the news: Japan was at peace—and had been for decades. Finally, Onoda surrendered, and the Philippines pardoned him for his actions.\n\nLike Onoda, all of us were once at war. In sin, an old cycle is at work. Strife leads to strife. We are enemies of God (Romans 5:10), enemies of our neighbor (Ephesians 2:12), and even our own nature is at war within us (Galatians 5:17; Romans 7:23). But Christ has triumphed over sin. First, through Him, we are reconciled to God. “Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). That peace is the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer.\n\nLike Onoda’s commander, the Holy Spirit comes to us in our wilderness and gives us peace. With the fruit of the Spirit, the Holy Spirit starts a new cycle. We love because God loves us. We have peace with God, so we find peace with our neighbor. “But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah. For he is our peace, who made both groups one and tore down the dividing wall of hostility” (Ephesians 2:13–14). The Holy Spirit leads us and bears fruit in our life, so we do not gratify our sinful nature (Galatians 5:16), and by the Spirit, we are able to have peace with ourselves.\n\nIn that way, we are different from Onoda. His commander brought news that peace had come through defeat. His war was lost. The Holy Spirit comes to us to tell us that our war is won. The peace of the Holy Spirit is the peace of Christ’s triumph, not over us, but over our enemies of sin and death. We are not defeated; instead, the Holy Spirit gives us a conqueror’s share in Christ’s victory and peace. Peace between us and God. Peace inside for the believer. Peace within the Church. Peace for the nations. We do not stand guard any longer but surrender to the Holy Spirit as the guardian of our hearts. And because of Christ Jesus, the peace of God, “which transcends all understanding,” continues to guard our hearts and minds, granting us His perfect peace (Philippians 4:7).\n\nWritten by David Chaniott\n\n",

Why is it so hard to keep that joy in our hearts?\n\nI’m willing to bet I’m not the only Christ-follower who wants to plant his feet on the firm foundation of that “inexpressible and glorious joy” that comes with knowing and loving Jesus (1 Peter 1:8), but when it comes down to it, moments of disappointment and deprivation find us feeling bereft of joy. Too often, our circumstances dictate the disposition of our hearts.\n\nThis is precisely when we must remember that joy is not something we can manufacture, nor is it something our daily experiences can sustainably provide. The joy of the Spirit is something God cultivates in us—a fruit we get to enjoy by the hand of the Master Gardener.\n\nJoy of the ineffable, unshakeable variety is one of the heavenly attributes that grows within us when our hearts make a home for the Holy Spirit. When Paul writes, “Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you believe so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit” (Romans 15:13), we take note that joy begets hope. And what does hope do? Hope gets us out of bed in the morning. Hope reminds us of the truth so we can press on. Hope drives us back to Scripture where we find the encouragement to keep running into the arms of Jesus, whence that deep abiding joy derives.\n\nThe next time one of your “sweet spots” is interrupted or removed, run to Jesus with a needy heart. Humble yourself under the hand of God and ask the Holy Spirit to bear fruit in you. Remember that He is your portion and that the beautiful inheritance He has promised is irrevocably yours in Jesus. Then, even in the darkest of times, His joy will make your heart glad, your whole being rejoice, and even your body rest securely (Psalm 16:9).\n\nJust as it takes daily work to tend a garden, so must we cultivate a daily habit of humbly returning to our God. When our heart, mind, and will are attuned to His, He grows and shares His perfect joy and peace with us.\n\nWritten by Alex Florez\n\n",

    "devo_title": "Love",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nIt’s striking that love is listed first when describing the fruit of the Spirit, because as it’s portrayed and understood in Western culture, love has little to do with the Holy Spirit. Cultural “love” is sentimental or romantic, primarily a feeling. It is mysterious and fickle, capturing some people and leaving others stranded. It sweeps some people away then dashes them against the rocks. It is a good thing, definitely, but also something easy to resent when others have it and you don’t. This is not at all what the Bible tells us about love, nothing like the fruit of the Holy Spirit’s transforming work.\n\nScripture tells us, “God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him” (1John 4:16). This does not mean God is only love without other defining traits, or that love is God, as if it is a thing to be worshiped of its own accord. Rather, it means that God is the originator of love and all characteristics of true love are characteristics of God. Real love stems from God because “He has given us of his Spirit” (1John 4:13).\n\nThe best way to understand this real love is to see what God says about it. In Deuteronomy, Moses is speaking to Israel, this newly formed and chosen people of God freshly rescued out of slavery, and he tells them this about their rescuer:\n\n“[God] will not leave you, destroy you,\n\nor forget the covenant with your ancestors that he swore to them by oath,\n\nbecause the LORD your God is a compassionate God….\n\nBecause he loved your ancestors,\n\nhe chose their descendants after them” (Deuteronomy 4:31,37).\n\nGod’s love, unlike any earthly notion of love, is defined by commitment. He is a covenant-keeping God, a promise keeper, an unfailing presence to those He loves.\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 13, the apostle Paul lays out what love is and why it matters so much to all believers. He begins by listing a bunch of great things, other gifts of the Holy Spirit—tongues, eloquence, prophecy, knowledge, understanding, faith—but then says each of these is nothing without love. Love is what makes those things matter. Then Paul describes what love looks like; it’s patient, kind, not envious or boastful, not arrogant or rude or selfish. Instead, it rejoices in truth, hoping and believing the best, it remains despite circumstances (vv.4–7). To be loving is to embody all the Spirit’s work in your life—it isn’t a separate characteristic.\n\nPaul closes his description with this sentence: “Love never ends” (1Corinthians 13:8). This is no mere feeling or sentiment. “Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins…. We love because he first loved us” (1John 4:10,19). Love, as the world knows it, is a sweet feeling while it lasts, but it can’t be counted on. Love, as God offers it, never ends because it stems from His eternal, unfailing, perfect heart, through the work of His Son and the Holy Spirit for all who believe. It is the means of our salvation, our growth as Christians, and it is the visible evidence that we are in Christ.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod gives us the fruit of the Spirit because He loves us. In many ways, it’s that simple. The fruit is a promised result of walking in step with the Spirit. But what is this fruit? How does it grow? Allow me to offer five observations about the fruit of the Spirit as we begin this reading plan.\n\nFirst, what’s the metaphor? These qualities listed as the collective fruit of the Spirit have a tangibility to them. I like to think of the fruit of the Spirit like a cluster of grapes. They grow as one fruit, drawing nutrients from the same source, and yet they are distinct.\n\nSecond, when do they grow? Like all fruit, the fruit of the Spirit grows slowly and seasonally. Anyone who promises Christian maturity overnight is selling something you don’t need. The psalmist says that the one who follows the Lord “is like a tree planted beside flowing streams” of water “that bears its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers” (Psalm 1:3). Real change is usually gradual. We don’t always see this growth, but we can see the evidence of it.\n\nThird, spiritual growth is inevitable for those who are in Christ. If you have the Spirit, you will grow. Of course, we can, and often do, hinder the Spirit’s work in us. But the promise is that because God is calling us to walk in step with His Spirit (Galatians 5:25), and because the Holy Spirit dwells in those who trust in Christ, His Spirit is actively growing His people according to His perfect will.\n\nFourth, spiritual growth is comprehensive. It touches every aspect of your life, and the fruit of the Spirit—“love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control” (Galatians 5:22–23)—spans the whole of the human experience.\n\nFifth, all aspects of the fruit of the Spirit are interdependent on one another. They are linked together and thus grow together. You are not going to grow in your patience without also growing in your self-control. You are not going to deepen in your sense of peace without also deepening in your faithfulness and gentleness toward others. These are all rooted in the first aspect of this fruit: love. And they are all grown in grace. So we can know that the Spirit’s desire is not merely to grow one aspect, but to grow in us as one, collective fruit.\n\nThe fruit of the Spirit is not a set of qualities to achieve on our own and then present to the Lord for His approval. It is the Spirit’s work in us—the evidence of His sanctifying grace at work in our lives. We tend the vine, but the Lord makes the fruit grow.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

Amos 5:15 reads, “Hate evil and love good.” One of the profound characteristics of a maturing Christ follower is a desire to live in the tension of hating evil while loving our enemies. In a way, this is the heart of the gospel: Christ came carrying an unwavering disdain for the sin at work in us while maintaining an unwavering love for us. We are also called to remain faithful and truthful keeping company with those who are reliable (Proverbs 25:19).\n\nReflection Questions:\n\nHow often would you say you are caught in an internal struggle between good and evil?\n\nRead Proverbs 3:3. What does it mean to tie faithfulness around your neck and write it on the tablet of your heart?\n\nWho are some faithful people in your life?

To help you better engage with the proverbs in this reading plan, we have provided you with a short introduction and reflection questions for each day.\n\nThere is nothing inherently sinful about wealth. God gave King Solomon great wealth, and He continues to use the generosity of His people to fund important works of mercy and justice around the world. But God’s people are called to be very careful when it comes to the pursuit of wealth and very generous when it comes to caring for the poor. Money is more than a means to buy the things we need. It is power, and it always has been. Love of money is a “root of all kinds of evil,” because it is often the love of being able to wield power for our own benefit (1 Timothy 6:10).\n\nReflection Questions:\n\nHave you ever financially over-extended yourself? If so, what did that experience teach you?\n\nRead Proverbs 11:28. What else does God’s Word teach you about trust? Why shouldn’t you trust in your riches?\n\nBeing as honest with yourself as you can be, do you think you are a person who easily sees the poverty in and around you? Why is it important to remember that God made us all, regardless of our wealth or social status?\n\n",

One makes us sick; one makes others well. The true problem with gluttony is not about how much we consume. It has to do with our ability to practice self-control, an essential component of generosity. Generosity is always an exercise in self-control because it requires us to give when our instinct is to keep. Consider how these proverbs link gluttony and generosity together and let their wisdom hold up a mirror for you.\n\nReflection Questions: \n\nThink of a time you withheld, knowing you should have been generous.

Wisdom is not just the accumulation of knowledge. It is a way we walk through life, seeking to know and live out God’s truth. Folly, in the biblical sense of the word, is to hold the pursuit of truth in contempt by choosing to make our own path.

There, I said it.\n\nThough some misguided souls have taken this sentiment as a license to sin without fear of repercussion, and though some have found it distasteful to presume upon the Lord for such long-suffering without us kicking in at least a little merit, I defy you to find one single verse in the Bible that says a person can sin their way out of God’s grip of grace.\n\nOf course people can claim a faith that isn’t genuine, but if Jesus has redeemed a soul, not even the vilest demons of hell can reclaim it. In Christ, our place in God’s presence is secure. We cannot be separated from His love.\n\nLook at how clearly Jesus says this in John 6:37–39. He says all that the Father gives to Him will come to Him, and He will never cast them out. He won’t lose anyone; He’ll raise them all up on the last day. As Paul wrote to the believers in Rome, “Whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord” (Romans 14:8).\n\nChances are there’s at least some part of you that wants to object to the “once saved, always saved” idea. Maybe it’s the presumptive way that phrase can be used to cheapen grace. That’s fair. We mustn’t ever cheapen grace. But often the objection is in response to the extravagance of the claim. It’s too good. How could it possibly be true?\n\nTHAT question right there—How could it possibly be true that our place in God’s presence is secure?—is one of the best questions you could ever ask, because it is not a rhetorical question, but rather a question with an answer. And it’s a glorious answer.\n\nConsider everything we’ve read in this four-week study. Consider God’s purpose in making us for His presence, and how we broke that relationship through sin. Think of the devastation of the fall of humanity, and all the brokenness that entered the world as a result. Think of our utter inability to reconcile ourselves to God. Think of the incarnation of Jesus—God come in the flesh for the purpose of living and dying in our place and defeating the power of death. Think of the war between good and evil waged on our behalf. Think of the way the angels sang in triumphant chorus at the birth of Jesus, and how they sing in Revelation that He alone is worthy of all blessing and honor and glory. Think of how we, the Church, are called His beloved Bride, which He adorns with splendor and makes radiant.\n\nWhat could you possibly do to undo all of that?\n\nThere is nothing cheap about believing that our salvation is secure because it is not our performance that makes it so. The work of Christ makes it so. What cheapens grace is suggesting we have it in ourselves to overrule the gracious purposes of God and thwart the resurrection power of Jesus through our conduct.\n\nThe good news of the gospel is that you were made for an intimate relationship with your Creator, and because of the finished work of Christ on behalf of all who believe, you will have that relationship for all eternity. To Him be the glory.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

It all came to a head in the spring when Susie and I set a time to meet and decide whether or not we should remain “just friends” or try dating. Friends since middle school, we were set to meet on a Wednesday night to define our relationship moving forward. From the time class was over that Wednesday until the time we were set to meet, I fasted and prayed—about five hours in all. I had never felt as close to God as I did then. Up until that point, I’d never in my life been more aware of the Holy Spirit ministering to me. The truth of “God with us” in the Holy Spirit became real in my life that day.\n\nWhen Jesus Christ was preparing to leave His disciples on earth following the resurrection, He commissioned them to go, make disciples of all nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:18–19). Immediately following this Great Commission, Jesus bestowed on them this comforting truth: “Remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age” (v.20).\n\nJesus is with us not in His physical, embodied presence as He was in the incarnation, ministering with His disciples around Israel. He is with us in the person of the Holy Spirit. When Jesus left this earth and joined His Father in heaven, He sent the Holy Spirit as a Counselor and guide, and a promise that He will return again. In Ephesians 1:13–14, Paul writes:\n\nIn him you also were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit \n\nwhen you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and when you believed. \n\nThe Holy Spirit is the down payment of our inheritance, \n\nuntil the redemption of the possession, to the praise of his glory.\n\nGod is always with us in the presence of the Holy Spirit. Whether we’re fretting about whether or not to take that new job, dreading a difficult conversation with a loved one, or facing the greatest pangs of temptation we’ve ever faced, the Holy Spirit, our helper, is with us, reminding us of what is true. The Holy Spirit points us to the source of our hope. The Holy Spirit reminds us that no failure we commit is beyond the bounds of God’s grace. The Holy Spirit helps us pray when we don’t know what to pray (Romans 8:26).\n\nSusie and I started dating and eventually got married. But I remember very little of the conversation we had that Wednesday night in May 2009. What I remember most is that, before the conversation, the Holy Spirit reminded me that my joy and contentment are to be rooted in the Lord, and that nothing that would ever happen to me could make that untrue.\n\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWe are called to follow Jesus and walk with Him daily, learning about life in His kingdom.\n\nWe sometimes mistakenly think that those who lived in Jesus’s day had an easier time leaving behind everything they had known to follow Him. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, we see just how much the disciples left behind to follow the Savior. In Matthew 4:18–24, Jesus calls two sets of brothers, all of whom were professional fishermen. Back in that day, this also meant they were businessmen, and the Gospel records imply that James and John were heirs to a lucrative family fishing business.\n\nWhat was it that enabled these men—and the multitude of other disciples to leave such things as family members, jobs, and social statuses—to “immediately” leave their nets, their former way of life, and follow Christ? (Matthew 4:20). Maybe it was because they recognized the divine presence in the one who was calling them. The same call God had issued to Abraham so long ago, He also issued to men and women in the days of His incarnation.\n\nAs a young Christian, Michael Card’s song “Things We Leave Behind” left a deep impact on me, particularly found these opening verses:\n\nThere sits Simon, so foolishly wise;\n\nProudly he’s tending his nets\n\nThen Jesus calls and the boats drift away\n\nAll that he owns he forgets.\n\nBut more than the nets he abandoned that day,\n\nHe found that his pride was soon drifting away.\n\nAnd it’s hard to imagine the freedom we find\n\nFrom the things we leave behind.\n\nThere is an analogy to be drawn between Peter abandoning his fishing nets and his leaving behind other aspects of his life when he came to follow Christ. In leaving their nets, these men were leaving their former way of life and learning to walk in the presence of God.\n\nOf course, the disciples’ lives were being shaped as they walked in Jesus’s presence. They were learning more of the glory, wisdom, grace, power, truth, justice, and compassion of God, as they followed Him throughout the promised land. They were listening intently to His teaching, His parables, His warnings, and His promises. They were seeing His miracles. They were willing to walk with Him to the point of His suffering on the cross for their sins. It was this last act of the Savior on earth that they particularly needed to embrace if they were going to be His disciples. He had come to suffer for their sins and for the sins of His people throughout the world.\n\nIf we are to walk in the presence of God, we, too, are called to follow Christ. This may mean leaving family members, jobs, societal comforts, and even our own expectations. In whatever form it may take, of this much we can be sure: as we leave behind things that keep us from the Savior, we will discover that we gain more than we ever leave behind. As we walk in the presence of God, we will find a joy that we belong to Him, that He has died for us, and that He is conforming us into His glorious image.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n",

Before he plunged downhill, he perched at the starting line and raised both hands in triumph. He had already won the gold medal. Olympic half-pipers run twice and keep their best score. Sean’s first score topped all the other snowboarders’ first and second runs. He could have scooted down the half-pipe on his belly like an otter and taken the gold medal. This second run was a victory lap.\n\nEvery day, God’s people are perched on the same line. God calls His people to take part in establishing His promised kingdom on earth. Before any sermon is preached, before any gift is given, before any disciple is made, or prayer offered, God’s presence secures victory for His Church. The medal is already His.\n\nThat does not mean every day will feel like a victory lap. The book of Joshua begins with the Israelites perched on the Jordan River, ready to cross over into the promised land. They faced a long struggle against their enemies. God also gave them the high bar of His law to follow, which they would fail to reach again and again. God still assured them, “Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go” (Joshua 1:9). The Israelites took those first steps into the promised land on that alone, hoping that God would be with them as He had been with Moses. Again and again, God demonstrated His presence in dramatic miracles. The Jordan parted, the walls of Jericho fell, the sun stood still, and even more was still to come in Christ.\n\nIn Romans, Paul talks about the sufferings Christians face. It is not a rosy list. Death, famine, persecution, and violence are only the highlights. Against these things, Paul weighs the love of Christ and asks, “If God is for us, who is against us?” (Romans 8:31). Since God has not even spared His own Son, then nothing can stand against His love. Christ has justified us and unites us with God, and now nothing can separate us from that love.\n\nWhen you face the day, know that God’s words to you are true. He is with you. When God tells you “I will not leave you or forsake you” (Joshua 1:5), He is telling you the score. The victory is already secure. Nothing you do and nothing that happens will separate you from His love in Christ. His kingdom has already won, even when we can only hope for it. Knowing this gives you the freedom to act, confident of the outcome, like Sean White in the Olympics. Afterall, his second half-pipe score—that “victory lap” run—is still the highest score in the history of the sport.\n\nWritten by Dave Chaniott\n\n",

Over the last several months, we’ve been absent from one another physically, or had the presence of our faces covered by masks. I have no idea what the coming months will hold.\n\nWhatever your current circumstances, consider with me now what it’s like to miss someone’s presence. These months of social distancing remind me of what our relationship with Christ is like. As long as we are home in our bodies, we’re away from His bodily presence (2Corinthians 4:6–8; 5:8). Because Jesus has ascended to heaven, we can only see Him through the eyes of faith. In fact, the whole Christian life is characterized by faith like that of Abraham and his descendants: a faith that longs for, waits for, and looks forward to what we can’t see right now. For now, we only see Christ through a glass darkly, as if we’re chatting through a Zoom call, but one day we’ll see Him face to face (1Corinthians 13:12).\n\nAnd yet, even though Christ’s presence is mediated now by the Spirit, we can still experience His presence daily. From the call of Abram (Genesis 12) to our inclusion as Christ’s spiritual descendants (Acts 3:25), God’s promises to His people have been marked by His presence. God’s presence with us through His Word and Spirit confirms His covenant commitment to us (Genesis 12:2–3; 17:2,4; 26:3–4). His presence with us also reveals our identity as His children (Genesis 12:7; 17:5,7; 26:24; 28:13). Our Savior says to us as He did to Isaac, “Do not be afraid. I am with you” (Genesis 26:24, emphasis mine). He comforts us as He did Jacob: “Look, I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go… I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you” (Genesis 28:15, emphasis mine).\n\nChrist is a faithful friend, so His presence doesn’t flatter. At times, His presence may not feel like comfort; sometimes it will feel as though we’re wrestling with Him, and sometimes we may feel wounded (see Genesis 32:22–32). We may see God’s face and yet be spared (v.30), but one thing is for certain: we cannot experience His presence and stay the same. When we share a rich personal connection with God, we emerge changed.\n\nSo as I think about how I’ve missed and longed for the presence of my friends, I’m giving thanks for the presence of my God. May our days be marked by His present guidance and a longing to see His gracious and transforming face.\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nOne day, in the new heavens and new earth, God will dwell with His people as He did in the beginning.\n\nNot too long ago, I was showing my neighbor the firepit I built in my backyard. Around the firepit, I placed large patio stones in a circular pattern and planted grass in between them, along with five Adirondack chairs. When showing my neighbor the fruit of my labor I remarked, “This is my sanctuary,” and in many ways it is. I often end my day spending time there. In fact, many nights I sit there quietly in prayer, simply dwelling in the presence of God.\n\nNow, my backyard is a far cry from what it must have been like in the garden of Eden. However, it often stirs my biblical imagination of what it must have been like to walk in the physical presence of God in the cool of the day (Genesis 3:8). Built into the very fabric of humanity is a desire to experience the presence of God. In fact, the story of Scripture begins and ends with the presence of God.\n\nIn the book of Genesis, Eden is the first human’s home but, more importantly, it is also God’s garden temple. A sacred space where the Creator God and His image-bearers dwell together. However, when sin entered the world, Adam and Eve (along with all of humanity) were cast out of God’s holy presence. Paradise was lost. Even more, the initial command to build out the earth as the city of God was left unfulfilled. Heaven and earth were separated. The world we dwell in now is broken, and longing for redemption. The people of the earth drift around, looking for anything that will fill the gaping hole that can only be filled with God’s presence.\n\nThe apostle John speaks directly to this when Jesus is introduced in his Gospel account as coming to dwell among us. What a breathtaking reality. Jesus, the God-man had come and walked among us. His message was that the kingdom of God had come near (Mark 1:15). In other words, what Adam and Eve failed to do, Jesus came to make right. Jesus lived the perfect life according to God’s holy standards, something none of us could do. Jesus died a sacrificial death for us, in our place, so that we could be granted access to the presence of God again.\n\nAt the end of the Bible, in the book of Revelation, John speaks again of a day when Jesus will come again and bring heaven and earth back together, depicting a time when paradise will be regained. What a marvelous promise to be able to one day say with John, “Look, God’s dwelling is with humanity, and he will live with them” (Revelation 21:3).\n\nAs I write this, I am sitting in my backyard “sanctuary,” and it’s a pale shadow of the garden city that we will dwell in one day for all of eternity. Even as I sit here quietly in prayer, reflecting on the presence of God, I cannot imagine what it will be like to see my God face to face. In a few hours, the fire before me will disappear into the darkness. But one day, the darkness will disappear in the light of His glory forevermore. On that day, our life in the garden city with God will never end.\n\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nThe people of God are the temple of God; His presence is active in the Church.\n\n“I miss my church.”\n\nThat’s the common refrain I heard from my friends when congregations weren’t meeting in person because of COVID-19. Most of the folks I heard say this attended churches that offered some type of online service, so when they said, “I miss my church,” they weren’t talking about the music or the preaching. When I probed a little deeper, their meaning was clear: they missed the people. They longed to see their church family face to face again.\n\nThe apostle Paul stressed the mysterious unity we enjoy in Christ in 1 Corinthians 3. The Corinthian church was facing an issue that is not unfamiliar to us; the church found itself divided over different teachers. One person would say that he followed Paul, while another claimed to follow Peter, and yet another devoted himself to Apollos. Then, the brother who desired to correct everyone would step in and proclaim, “Well, I follow Christ.”\n\nThese divisions fractured the unity of the Body of Christ, so Paul reminded them of their corporate identity. He asked, “Don’t you yourselves know that you are God’s temple and that the Spirit of God lives in you?” (1Corinthians 3:16). Paul used the language of the temple, which would have been familiar to those who were steeped in the scriptures. As we’ve read over the last two weeks, in the Old Testament, the presence of God dwelt in the temple and people who wanted to meet with God had to go there. But even then, only the high priest could enter the most holy place.\n\nThen we read about how when Jesus came, He used temple language to talk about Himself. In John 2, when He turned over tables in the temple, Jesus told the crowd, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days” (v.19). The crowd seemed confused by His words and mocked Him, but John explains that “he was speaking about the temple of his body” (v.21). Jesus is the new temple. Now we enter the presence of God not in a building, but through faith in Him.\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 3:16, Paul extended this metaphor: God’s people have been filled with the Holy Spirit and now the presence of God is in us and active among us. This is especially true when the Church is together. using our gifts to serve each other, which demonstrates that the Spirit is among us.\n\nThe people of God are a reminder of God’s presence. We’re reminded of His presence by the encouragers, the ones who the Spirit uses to lift us up when we are down. He works through those with the gift of hospitality, those who warmly welcome us and care for us, reminding us that God has welcomed us into His forever family. He works through our friends with the gift of mercy, because their presence with us during difficult times is a tangible reminder of God’s steadfast presence. We need the Church because it reminds us that God loves us completely, that He is always with us, and that He is always for us.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nOn the day of Pentecost, God’s presence was poured out on believers.\n\nIn high school, late summer in the Piedmont of North Carolina was the convergence of two realities for me: a humid heat that seemingly made every fiber of the universe stick to my sweaty skin, and the torture of three-a-day football practices in the previously mentioned heat. The pre-season physical conditioning was enough to double a man over, but the heat that came with it made the practices unbearable. That is, until about 3 o’clock in the afternoon. Mysteriously (at least to our experience), each afternoon brought a rumbling thunder from the West, accompanied by the coolest, most refreshing downpour of rain that ended up curtailing the humidity, heat, and weariness of our lengthy practices. With the first echo of thunder, you’d see a group of thirty or so football players in full gear run out into the middle of the field to be embraced by the drenching water that would soon fall.\n\nI imagine the writers of the scriptures envisioned the sending of the Holy Spirit similarly. The land is dry (Isaiah 44:3); the people are parched and barren. But something powerful occurs when the Spirit of God is sent among His people. Refreshment comes and blessing abounds. Justice, righteousness, security, and peace flourish. A powerful refreshment of Spirit-given life is bestowed upon the entire world.\n\nWhen we consider our lives today, and the nature of the world around us, we long for the refreshment of the Spirit of God upon us. The good life that we desire is not some pipe dream that elusively sits outside of our grasp. Nor is it a purchased and earned experience that is the result of our abundant faith, our good intentions, or even our best deeds.\n\nNo, the refreshment and life-giving sending of the Holy Spirit is the grace of God’s smile upon us (Ezekiel 39:29). The sending of the Holy Spirit to indwell every follower of Jesus is God turning His face of love toward His people. God brings His refreshment, blessing, and peace upon us through the Holy Spirit.\n\nYou might wonder how and when can you get the refreshment of the Holy Spirit. When might this “downpour” come upon our lives? Scripture tells us that following the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, the promises of God were fulfilled in the sending of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2). What the prophet Joel had envisioned as the refreshment of God that waters dry and weary hearts (Joel 2:28) occurred that day as Peter preached Jesus as Lord.\n\nYou haven’t missed out on the refreshing downpour of the Spirit of God in your life. Joel’s prophecy is for “all humanity,” and as Peter proclaimed in Acts 2, “The promise is for you and for your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call” (Acts 2:39). Like my football buddies standing in the middle of the rain, today we can enjoy the pouring out of the Spirit of God upon us by faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nThe presence of God came to earth and dwelt among people in Jesus Christ.\n\nWe have all had experiences that we will likely never forget. For me, one of those moments happened when I was 24 years old, standing at the top of the French Alps, overlooking the seemingly endless miles of mountains. I’d never seen such a glorious sight in my life.\n\nThis is as close as I’ve come to imagining the disciples’ experience of certain events that occurred during their time with Christ—events that likely left an indelible mark on their minds and hearts. The transfiguration was such an experience for Peter, James, and John. Reflecting back on his witness to the ministry of Jesus, the apostle John wrote, “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. We observed his glory, the glory as the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). John was astonished by what he’d witnessed on the Mount of Transfiguration.\n\nIn the Old Testament, the tabernacle was the dwelling place of God. Just as God’s people lived in tents, so God came to dwell with them in a tent. The tent dwelling of God in the tabernacle was a type of God’s ultimate dwelling with His people in the tabernacle of the flesh of Christ. Since God’s children partook of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise partook of flesh and blood. In Jesus, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily. This is the reason why Jesus could speak of His body as the temple that would be destroyed and raised back up in three days (John 2:19).\n\nThe temple was a more permanent dwelling place for God than the tabernacle had been, though it, too, was ultimately temporary. God had planned a greater and more intimate dwelling place. God planned on coming in the flesh. When Jesus disputed with the religious leaders in Israel, He bore witness to the fact that “something greater than the temple” had come (Matthew 12:6). He who filled the heavens and the earth—who could not be contained by a building—united a human nature to His divine nature, thereby becoming God and man in one person forever.\n\nBy entering into the world in the person of Jesus, God came to reestablish His presence with His people. Christ is greater than the tabernacle and temple. Because God dwelt fully in the Person of Christ, believers will dwell in His presence forever. By faith in Christ, we have direct access into the very presence of God.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n",

    "devo_title": "God’s Presence Leaves the Temple",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhen God’s people turned away from Him, He removed His presence from the temple.\n\nFrom the very beginning of Scripture, God is a covenant maker—with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and on and on. God established a people for Himself based on this repeated covenant: “I will be your God and you will be my people” (Jeremiah 7:23). He formed them as a nation, gave them a home, then had them build a temple that would become His house among them, where He dwelt with them and His glory was manifest.\n\nWe must remember the full covenant promise. God told His people that He would bless them and be with them if they kept His commands and pursued no other gods, and He warned them of judgment and consequence if they abandoned His ways. In Jeremiah 7 we see this proclaimed clearly when He calls on the people to execute justice, to not oppress the vulnerable, to not shed innocent blood, and to not seek after other gods (vv.5–7). If they do this, He tells them, they will be free to live in the land and He will dwell there with them. The passage goes on to describe how God’s people have believed deceptive words and persisted in their sin to the point that God asks them:\n\n“Has this house, which bears my name, \n\nbecome a den of robbers in your view? \n\nYes, I too have seen it” (v.11).\n\nThe Israelites had so departed from God that even His holy temple had become marked by their selfishness and thievery. And this was not God’s only Fatherly warning to His people. In verses 23–25 God recounts how, through the nation’s leaders and prophets, He has been summoning and calling them to obedience since they were freed from Egypt.“Yet they didn’t listen or pay attention but followed their own advice and their own stubborn, evil heart. They went backward and not forward” (v.24).\n\nSo God kept His promise. He departed the temple. He “cast the people out of His sight” and “plucked them up” from the land He had given them and from His house, the temple (2Chronicles 7:19–21). Ezekiel 10 paints a powerful picture of God’s departure as a whirling, mysterious, magnificent cloud that filled the temple court with brightness before going “out from the threshold of the temple… and it stopped at the entrance to the eastern gate of the LORD’s house” (vv.4,18–19).\n\nThere is a seeming hopelessness in those words. It is especially grim when we realize that we are so like the people of Israel—prone to stubborn rebellion against God. But remember who else used the words from Jeremiah 7 and called the temple a “den of robbers”: Jesus, God Himself, when driving out the money changers in Matthew 21:13. It is in Jesus that our hope lies, the very presence of God sent to dwell among us.\n\nGod promised this very thing in the book of Haggai, declaring, “Once more, in a little while… I will fill this house with glory…. The final glory of this house will be greater than the first… I will provide peace in this place” (vv.6,7,9). God, the covenant maker, does not abandon His covenant or His people. He took His presence from the people as judgment, but always with the intent to restore His presence to His people, and to us, through the life and work of Jesus Christ.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod’s presence filled the temple, and His people drew near and worshiped Him.\n\nPicture this: Solomon and the elders of Israel escort the ark of the covenant into the temple. There are people everywhere. The priests then take over and take the ark into the Holy Place, the inner sanctum. And then when they withdraw, a cloud appears and it is so overwhelming that the “ the priests were not able to continue ministering, for the glory of the Lord filled the temple” (1Kings 8:11).\n\nCan you imagine? Everyone is gathered and there is an expectation of the priests immediately beginning their work. But things don’t go according to plan, because the glory of the Lord fills the temple in what we’re told looks like a cloud. The temple was a constant reminder of God’s glory and presence. Picture it: Maybe you’re traveling down the road into the city of Jerusalem when you look up to see the temple dominating the cityscape, and you think to yourself, Yahweh is with us here.\n\nI don’t know about you, but this passage makes me think a lot about Jesus. I think about how He referred to Himself, saying, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up again in three days” (John 2:19). I remember how Philip asked Jesus to show them the Father, and Jesus responded boldly, telling them that anyone who has laid eyes on Him has also seen the Father (John 14:9). In John 17, He goes on to pray what is known as the High Priestly Prayer, starting with: “Now, Father, glorify me in your presence with that glory I had with you before the world existed” (v.5). When we look at the living, breathing person of Jesus, who walked the dusty roads of Jerusalem, Bethany, Capernaum, and more as detailed throughout the Gospels, we are also seeing the glory of God.\n\nJesus is the glory of God on full display in flesh and blood. We see the glory of His wisdom in how to navigate this world as a human. We see the glory of His kindness to the marginalized. We see the fullness of His glory in His love for sinners as He dies in their place on the cross. And we see the fullness of His glory in the King conquering sin and death and making us citizens of His eternal kingdom of love and joy and peace.\n\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod provided a place for His people to draw near to Him.\n\nGod’s dwelling with His people has been the plan from the very beginning. This is the story of Scripture, from the first page to the last, from the garden to an eternal garden city where we will finally dwell with our God and see Him face to face (1John 3:2). Sadly, this union was hindered by sin’s entrance into the garden. Even still, the faithlessness and rebellion of those He has created cannot nullify the faithfulness and grace of their Creator. Following God’s unfolding plan to restore His dwelling place among His people is essential to understanding the tabernacle.\n\nReaching back almost 3500 years into history, we discover a significant move of the God of Israel to re-establish a physical dwelling place to be with His people. This portable, earthly tent was used by the Israelites between their exodus from Egypt and the conquest of Canaan. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had not forgotten His people, and so He once again came to meet with what at the time was a small tribe of recently freed slaves wandering in the desert. Their faithlessness and idolatry did not prevent Him from remembering His covenant and providing a way for His people to dwell with Him. He instructs Moses, “They are to make a sanctuary for me so that I may dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8).\n\nThrough the sacrificial laws that would be fulfilled inside its walls, God more fully revealed to them the nature of their rebellion and need for atonement. Through each rich detail, God’s people would have been reminded of the garden, the paradise where humanity once dwelled with their Creator God, their true King. The entrance to the holy of holies, the ark of the covenant and the altar, the colors, shapes, materials, smells, and even the priest and his garments—everything pointed to their God.\n\nIn the days and weeks to come, we’ll read how this place for God’s presence transitioned in time to the temple in Jerusalem, and then most broadly to His presence among His people from every tribe, tongue, and nation, and by the Holy Spirit through their union with Christ. At each stage in this grand, unfolding, redemptive plan, God has not stopped pursuing His people, continuing to make a way to dwell with them.\n\nThroughout our lives we are likely to experience diverse seasons. At some points we may sense a garden’s lushness and at others times the confusion and barrenness of the desert. Regardless of what season we find ourselves in, we must remember that our God has never been satisfied for us to remain in lonely isolation, separated from Him and in a perpetually broken relationship. When we reflect back on the narrative of Scripture to read about the tabernacle, what we’re really being reminded of is that God has always longed to restore His people to Himself, so that we might dwell with Him forever. Through Christ, the work of the tabernacle has been completed, bringing us back to a place of unity and peace with our God and one another. We now wait longingly for His return, when we will dwell with Him in perfect harmony.\n\nWritten by Robert Wheeler\n\n",

    "devo_title": "God’s Presence Transforms His People",
    "devo_summary": "\n\nLike Moses’s face made radiant by standing in God’s presence on Mt. Sinai, God’s people are transformed by life in His presence.\n\nWe long for transformation. We long to change ourselves into happier selves, our homes and communities into better places of peace and cohesion, and our nation into a place of greater love and optimism.\n\nWe are also stumped in our attempts to achieve transformation. The hopes of yesterday are undone by the troubles of today. We look for solutions in self-empowerment, blaming others and blaming circumstances. We look for help from within, from friends and authorities driven by a kind of strong-arm mentality: If we can only push our ideas through, get our opinions out there, rally others to our program—then things could really be different. But our solutions don’t solve the problems.\n\nThe gospel offers a radically different answer. It doesn’t sit easy with us, largely because it has so little to do with our abilities and efforts. We want to do something, to fix things fast. But the gospel message of salvation begins and ends, not with our work, but God’s. Our position is shockingly and uncomfortably passive.\n\nGod declared to Moses: “I am coming to you.” Not the other way around. He also comes to Moses “in a dense cloud” (Exodus 19:9). This, too, is unsettling. We’d like Him to appear with a clear program; preferably, it should be obvious and efficient. In other words, we want it to look exactly like our plan. Why are His ways so shrouded in mystery?\n\nPart of the answer is that He comes “so that the people will hear” when He speaks (Exodus 19:9). There is to be no confusion about whose kingdom we are dealing with. God has not come to fulfill our plans, but to show us His plan. We are called to listen and obey.\n\nAnd we’re called to hear and receive with faith. God tells Moses He’s come so that the people will hear “and will always believe [Moses]” and the messages God speaks through him (v.9). God calls us to pay heed to His ministers; Abraham, Moses, Elijah, and the rest of the prophets have voiced God’s plan for transformation through the ages. Do we truly desire change? Do we long for a different world? Do we long for the coming kingdom? Then hear and obey the Word of the Lord.\n\nToday, the veil that covered the face of Moses has been removed, the dense cloud dispelled, and the mystery of the gospel revealed. Christ has opened access to the throne of God for you and me, and just as Moses’s face was transformed by the presence of God, so also we, “are looking as in a mirror at the glory of the Lord and are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory; this is from the Lord who is the Spirit” (2 Corinthians 3:18).\n\nIn a world that is constantly hungering for answers, we have the promise of real transformation, personally and culturally, in the presence of God. If we abide in Him, and He in us, we are made into the likeness of His eternal Son, Jesus Christ. His is the kingdom we are to seek, not our own. And with the coming of His kingdom, all these things will be added (Matthew 6:33).\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod’s presence was with Moses and with Israel as they were brought out of slavery in Egypt.\n\nAs a kid, I didn’t mind going to church. I liked the hymns and doodling in the margins of the pew hymnals. The one issue I had with the Sunday morning ritual was the dress code. For me, pressed khakis, dress shoes, and a button-down shirt were too constricting and uncomfortable. But my parents insisted that we dress up. I’ll never forget coming up with this theological argument around the age of twelve:\n\n“Hey mom,” I said. ”If God loves me unconditionally, doesn’t He still love me even if I don’t wear khakis?” I doubt I’m the only “rebellious” Christian kid to try this line of reasoning.\n\n“That’s true,” she responded. “But He also said to honor your father and mother. And I’m telling you to wear them to church.”\n\n(Maybe this is why I now attend a nondenominational church where jeans are considered acceptable attire.)\n\nGod never gets specific about church dress code in the Bible. But there are a few significant references to clothing in the scriptures. One of them shows up in the story of Moses’s interaction with a certain flambé shrubbery.\n\nIn Exodus chapter 3, Moses is watching his flocks when he sees an unusual sight. It’s hard to say how any of us would respond to a supernatural burning bush. But for his part, Moses is brave enough to investigate further. That’s when the bush speaks to him.\n\nAnd what’s one of the first things spoken to him through the bush? “Hey, can you take off your shoes? This is holy ground you’re walking on here” (Exodus 3:5, my paraphrase).\n\nThere are plenty of theories as to why Moses is asked to discalceate (a fancy word meaning “to remove shoes or footwear”) in God’s presence. My guess is that it has something to do with humility and reverence. I doubt Moses owned many pairs of shoes, so I imagine this footwear was probably precious to him. And so removing his shoes was an act of submission before the Lord. The ground probably wasn’t paved or even. So walking around in bare feet was likely uncomfortable, maybe even painful. Still, this was a small, but significant, sacrifice on Moses’s part.\n\nMoses kicks off those kicks without hesitation because he knows who’s speaking to him. He’s even (understandably) a little afraid. And it’s this submissive and willing attitude from Moses that God uses to lead His people out of slavery in Egypt.\n\nThe lesson here is that we’re sometimes called to do things for God that we don’t understand. Even if God asks us to do something small and unusual, it may be the first step to see if we’re prepared to obey something much bigger. We follow His instructions because obedience is required of us, and there is always purpose behind what He’s called us to do.\n\nWritten by Robert Carnes\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod created us to live and serve in His presence, but our sin made us unfit for life in the garden.\n\nI am fascinated by the thought of life in the garden of Eden before the fall. Scripture tells us, “The LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he placed the man he had formed” (Genesis 2:8). There, humanity once lived in perfect harmony and relationship with God. What was it like to have a clear conscience, no bills to pay, no broken marriages, no dirty politicians, no pandemics, no economies to collapse? What was it like to walk with God in the garden in the cool of the day?\n\nWorship itself is a kind of simulation of returning to Eden. When we gather as the people of God in corporate worship, by the invitation of His grace to us in our Lord Jesus, we gather to walk with Him without condemnation or fear, without shame or regret, without hostility or envy, without anxiety or hopelessness. God created us to live in His presence as our first parents did before the fall—without any of those things that bring us pain.\n\nBut those things are present with us now because of sin. When Adam and Eve sinned against the Lord, they took on a sinful nature that’s been passed down to every last one of us since. The absence of one single perfect person apart from Christ Himself is evidence that this is an inherited condition. When God put Adam and Eve outside the garden, He set angels with flaming swords to guard the gate. As the late, great musician Rich Mullins said, “The Lord wasn’t joking when he kicked them out of Eden.” The image of those seraphs with burning blades had to have been a terrifying sight.\n\nThe severity of our separation from Eden was more than a separation from a place. It was a separation from a person—from God’s presence. We fractured our relationship with Him in such a way that we could not repair it. If humanity was to have any hope of ever standing within the confines of that garden again, it would be because we were not only fit for Eden, but for the presence of the Lord Himself. For that to happen, God would have to be the one to restore us. He would have to be the one to repair what we’ve broken.\n\nWhen we think about the presence of God in the lives of His people, consider the miracle of redemption. Consider the magnificence of His restoring grace at work in our lives. Apart from His grace, our sin runs so deep that we cannot stand in the presence of God, no matter how hard we may try. But with His grace, the offense that set the angels with the flaming swords at their posts is not only pardoned; the offenders are restored to the kind of peace with our Creator that assures us that we will do one better than Adam and Eve. We will not walk with God in the garden in the cool of the day. We will sit at His banquet table as His beloved Bride in His kingdom forever (Revelation 19:6–9). All of this is by, and only by, the finished work of Jesus on our behalf.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nAs we focus our hearts and minds on Him, we become more aware of our ever-present God.\n\nI’ve found that awe always comes from wonder, from the beauty of a sunset on a clear mountain day to a rainbow over the beach after a summer shower to the sights and sounds of the county fair at night… Yep, that’s right: the county fair really is a magical place. It’s a playground with a vast array of possibilities, ranging anywhere from winning a large stuffed unicorn to getting food poisoning and everything in between.\n\nAnd so it was the summer my son was ten years old. With great anticipation, we’d parked the car in a large field, ready to enter into that wonderland of awe when my son slammed his finger in the car door. Honestly, I believe for a moment he’d altogether forgotten he was even at the county fair. His vocabulary in that moment was limited to just one word: “DADDY!”\n\nI can say from experience far beyond that day that nothing takes the wonder and awe out of life faster than pain. When God urges us to draw near, He knows something we sometimes forget: Life is often painful. It can be painful because of others, but also because of our own actions and attitudes. Pain never has the power to actually change what is true, but it can change what we believe is true—and we tend to live out of what we truly believe. So when God calls us to seek His face and His strength always (1Chronicles 16:11), it’s because He also knows that in our pain and distress, we forget who we are. We need His presence and compassion—His comfort—to remind us (Deuteronomy 4:29,31).\n\nBut as for me, God’s presence is my good.\n\nI have made the Lord GOD my refuge,\n\nso I can tell about all you do (Psalm 73:28).\n\nI held my son in my arms that night and kissed his finger a thousand times, trying to assure him that he was right to cry and it was going to be okay. As the pain began to subside he caught a glimpse of the giant ferris wheel off in the distance. Amazed and with his sense of wonder restored, he asked a simple question: “Dad, will you ride that with me?”\n\nWhen God urges us to draw near to Him, He is inviting us into His comfort, and comfort has the power to heal more than just what hurt me; it can also rewrite the broken narrative pain often invites me to believe. Comfort leads me to thankfulness that I’m not alone and that the God who is with me is kind and merciful. The comfort of His presence also leads me to remember what’s true, which might be the greatest of all gifts. When we remember the greater story of the gospel that is being told in and through our lives, we are given courage to awake from our pain, to look up in wonder and be reminded of who God is, but also who we are in relation to Him: those He dearly loves and who bear His image to a watching, waiting, and broken world.\n\nWritten by Randy Draughon\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWhen we remember God’s presence goes with us and before us, we can find comfort in any circumstance.\n\nTwo weeks into the summer I learned something I had never known. After a number of years working at a bank, I was overjoyed to be working as a teacher. I’d just finished my first year at a classical Christian school where I taught New Testament, systematic theology, and hermeneutics, and I’d loved every minute of it. The school was an exhilarating environment and one in which I thrived. The classroom was my sweet spot. Every day was a joy, and I was even thankful for the hard days and sometimes difficult students. But as great as it was, I was also looking forward to two months of summer.\n\nBut I couldn’t even begin to comprehend this kind of rest. Two months of family time and pool time, sleeping in, reading only what I wanted to read, and vacationing to St. Louis without coming right back to work—I couldn’t get my head around it. I’d longed for the days when I was off for the summer just like when I was a kid, but after two weeks, I realized something: this was not the rest I was looking for.\n\nSomething was missing. I could feel it in my bones and in my spirit. I needed a rest that was beyond summer days and nights and the smell of chlorine and sun on my skin. Don’t get me wrong; I still enjoyed the days off and the time spent with my three kids and my wife. I enjoyed waking up day after day without having to go anywhere except for a run, which would then be followed by… no work.\n\nWhat I realized was that I needed more than time off and leisurely hours. I began to see that the rest I longed for was the kind that could be accessed even while working and without two months off, in any season of life—the rest offered in the scriptures.\n\nI imagine Moses thought he needed a break too. Leading the Israelites out of Egypt was no cakewalk. And even after he led them out, they complained and whined and complained some more. Then, after turning his back for just a few days while on Mt. Sinai, the people forgot about their God and built a golden calf. So when God tells Moses to take His people and go into the promised land, Moses becomes worried; I can almost hear it in his voice, begging God to not abandon them. But God reassures him and says, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest” (Exodus 33:14).\n\nThat’s the rest I was looking for, the kind that can only be found in God’s presence. For the first time I understood Jesus’s offer of rest. When we place all our confidence in the life, teaching, death, and resurrection of Jesus that has brought us peace with God, well, that’s true and lasting rest—not the world’s version. We were made for more than even the sunniest days in this broken world; we were made for an eternity lived in God’s presence.\n\nWritten by Matt Redmond\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nWe can find courage and hope to endure all things because the powerful presence of our God goes with us.\n\nKing David’s life testified to the fact that God is an ever-present helper to His people. When we are overwhelmed by life’s troubles we may reach for our phones, though our phone calls to friends go unanswered. When at a crucial impasse we may seek the advice of trusted confidantes, but our text messages might go unseen. But God is always present and available and attentive—if only we’d turn to Him (2Timothy 4:16–18).\n\nGod was with David as he stood alone and protected his father’s sheep from predators the likes of lions and bears (1Samuel 17:34–36). God was with David when he and his fellow Israelites stood outmanned and outgunned before the opposing Philistine army and their giant, Goliath (1Samuel 17). God was with David when King Saul turned his ire against David and conspired to kill him (1Samuel 19). And God was even with David following David’s illicit tryst with Bathsheba and the subsequent murder of her husband, Uriah (2Samuel 12). Without fail, God is a helper who is always found in times of trouble (Psalm 46:1), even when that trouble is of our own concocting.\n\nAs the saying goes, “The shepherd smells like his sheep.” And rest assured, our Shepherd certainly smells like His sheep, because our God is unfailingly present among us. He is with His sheep, abiding with us and among us in the fields as we rest without a care in the world; He quiets us with His peace, but He also delights and rejoices in our very existence (Zephaniah 3:17). He is with His sheep among life’s dangerous crags, and more than that, He is faithful to gather us from the hazardous cliffs of this earthly life (Isaiah 40:11). And perhaps most profoundly, He is with His sheep in the darkness and in the mud, and He even helps us navigate our way out of the troubles that we create for ourselves (Matthew 18:12).\n\nDavid may have been king, but he was also once a shepherd, and he could clearly recall with great detail the duties of that former occupation. Perhaps he remembered the panicked bleating of his herd when a lion or bear would draw near, but also the trust his herd had in him and the calm that came over them when he was present. He himself knew the faithful presence of God. David knew that while everyone else may desert him, the Lord would remain, strengthening him to carry out his calling, but also tending to his own heart’s needs, rescuing him from evil when he strayed, and then bringing him safely back into the safety of His presence (2Timothy 4:16–18).\n\nEven in life’s bleakest moments and most unfavorable conditions, even when predators the likes of lions and bears are stalking nearby—“God is our refuge and strength, a helper who is always found in times of trouble “like these, so there is no need to be afraid (Psalm 46:1–3). Even if the ground we’re on seems to quake and give way, our God is with us and His presence supplies us with hope and courage against any odds.\n\nWritten by Sean Bess\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nOur holy God, through His grace and provision, welcomes imperfect people into His presence.\n\nImagine meeting your favorite president, leader, or one of the great kings or emperors from history. It would be intimidating and awe-inspiring, to be sure. But would you respond like this?\n\nWoe is me for I am ruined\n\nbecause I am a man of unclean lips\n\nand live among a people of unclean lips,\n\nand because my eyes have seen the King,\n\nthe LORD of Armies” (Isaiah 6:5).\n\nProbably not. Even the greatest ruler in human history or the finest, earthly throne room doesn’t deserve this kind of response.\n\nBut when the prophet Isaiah was ushered into the very presence of God and saw Him in all His inexpressible glory this was his response, and rightfully so (Isaiah 6:1–7). It would be our response, too, for we are of that same people of “unclean lips.” Revelation 4 paints an even fuller picture of the enormity and perfection of God’s glory as it describes the stormy wonder of His presence and then declares Him “holy, holy, holy, holy” and “worthy to receive glory and honor and power” (vv.8,11). Isaiah responded this way because he saw his own—all of humanity’s, really—lack of holiness and worthiness. We have no place in God’s presence. We are unclean because of sin.\n\nBut it was never God’s intention to separate Himself from His people. Throughout Scripture He proves Himself to be a rescuing and relating God. In Leviticus 11:45, God says, “For I am the LORD, who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God, so you must be holy because I am holy.” God is making clear His intention to be with His people and His expectation that we should be holy and sinless, like He is. But how? We are unclean and unworthy and can’t purify ourselves.\n\nGod knew this, too, and so He made a way for us to be with Him. Ephesians 2 lays it out for us so clearly: “But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ” (v.13). We were once unworthy, but we now have Jesus’s worthiness. Jesus is our peace, the reconciler of God and man (v.14). Jesus grants us access to the Father (v.18).\n\nGod sent His Son so that we would be able to enter His presence. He welcomes us through Christ so that we can “with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need” (Hebrews 4:16). The very God who is so holy and majestic as to strike Isaiah with fear, who is worthy of all praise and glory, who rescued His people from Egypt, is the God who now offers mercy and grace for those who come to Him through His Son. He welcomes us into His glorious presence, whole and purified in Jesus.\n\nWritten by Barnabas Piper\n\n",

    "devo_summary": "\n\nGod is not only universally present above and beyond creation; He is also personally present, dwelling with His people.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I thought the point of religion was to go to heaven when I died. And I thought of heaven as a paradise: streets of gold, pearly gates, private mansions—all that. I thought it would be a place that would have all my favorite things, all for free, and I could indulge every appetite without consequence of gaining weight or getting hurt. By going to church now, all this could be mine.\n\nThe story Scripture gives us about the purpose of faith in God, however, is radically different. Yes, God’s Word speaks of heaven, but the more you study and learn what the Bible has to say about about life after death, the more you’ll see that it has very little to do with the place itself, and has everything to do with the fact that we will be united to our Creator in face-to-face intimacy for all eternity, which is what our hearts long for the most. This is what Augustine was getting at when he wrote, “Every man who knocks on the door of a brothel is looking for God.” We were created to be in the presence of our Maker.\n\nColossians 1 has a series of verses that sing this truth with breathtaking majesty. “[Christ] is before all things, and by him all things hold together” (Colossians 1:17). The kid dreaming about those mansions with jewel-encrusted gates was thinking about the stuff of glory, not the source. Our God is not just a magnificent Creator who creates and then leaves. He creates for the purpose of eternal fellowship. He isn’t just present in the creation of the cosmos. He is personally still in the mix, present with His people—not just after we leave this life. He is with us now. Always.\n\nThe promise of God’s presence with us even now really is the beauty of the gospel. God’s call on the lives of His people is to Himself. Through Christ, He reconciles us to Himself, at His own cost, for the sake of His own glory, and for our eternal joy. This is both the beauty and perhaps one of the more elusive truths of Scripture, too: that God really is with us right now. It’s not that we’ll meet up with Him when we die. It’s not that He’ll show up now if we call out to Him. It’s that He is presently, actively holding all things together, including our lives. He is never not involved. Never not near. Never not working all things together for our good (Romans 8:28).\n\nI thank God that the point of faith is not merely to receive a reward at the end of this life, because this life can be so hard sometimes. I am thankful to know the Lord is always present, and always working here and now. This assures us that when we call to Him in prayer, He is already up to speed, and more presently invested in our flourishing than we could ever imagine. That’s better than a hundred mansions.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n",
